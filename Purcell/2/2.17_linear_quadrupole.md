## Problem Statement
Consider a "linear quadrupole" consisting of two adjacent dipoles oriented oppositely and placed end to end; see the left quadrupole in Fig. 2.16. There is effectively a point charge âˆ’2q at the center. By adding up the electric fields from the charges, find the electric field at a distant point (a) along the axis and (b) along the perpendicular bisector.
