## Problem Statement
(a) Consider a ring with charge Q and radius R. Let point P be a distance x from the plane of the ring, along the axis through its center. By adding up the contributions from all the pieces of the ring, find the electric field E(x) at point P.

(b) In the same manner, find the potential φ(x) at point P.

(c) Show that $E = -dφ/dx$.

(d) If a charge -q with mass m is released from rest far away along the axis, what is its speed when it passes through the center of the ring? Assume that the ring is fixed in place.
