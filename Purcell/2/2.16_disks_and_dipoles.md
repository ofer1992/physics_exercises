## Problem Statement
Two parallel disks each have radius R and are separated by a distance ℓ. The surface charge densities are σ and −σ. What is the electric field at a large distance r along the axis of the disks? Solve this in two ways.

(a) Treat the disks like a collection of a large number of dipoles standing next to each other.
(b) Explain why the parts of the two disks that are contained within the cone in Fig. 2.45 produce canceling fields at point P, and then find the field due to the uncanceled part of the top disk.
