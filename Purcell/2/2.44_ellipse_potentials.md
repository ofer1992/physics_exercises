## Problem Statement
The points $P_1$ and $P_2$ in Exercise 2.43 [[2.43_potential_from_rod]] happen to lie on an ellipse that has the ends of the rod as its foci, as you can readily verify by comparing the sums of the distances from $P_1$ and from $P_2$ to the ends of the rod. This suggests that the whole ellipse might be an equipotential. Test that conjecture by calculating the potential at the point (3d/2, 0, d), which lies on the same ellipse. Indeed it is true, though there is no obvious reason why it should be, that the equipotential surfaces of this system are a family of confocal prolate spheroids. See if you can prove that. You will have to derive a formula for the potential at a general point (x, 0, z) in the xz plane. Then show that, if x and z are related by the equation $x^2/(a^2-d^2) + z^2/a^2 = 1$, which is the equation for an ellipse with foci at z = Â±d, the potential will depend only on the parameter a (in addition to d), not on x or z.
