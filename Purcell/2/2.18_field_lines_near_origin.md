## Problem Statement
(a) Two equal positive charges q are located at the points (±a, 0, 0). Write down the potential φ(x, y) for points in the xy plane, and then use a Taylor expansion to find an approximate expression for φ near the origin. (You can set a = 1 to make things simpler.)

(b) Find the electric field at points near the origin. Then find the equations for the field lines near the origin by demanding that the slope dy/dx of a curve at a given point equals the slope $E_y/E_x$ of the field at that point.
