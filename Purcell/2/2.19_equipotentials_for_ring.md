## Problem Statement
(a) A ring with radius R has charge Q uniformly distributed on it. It lies in the xy plane, with its center at the origin. Find the electric field at all points on the z axis. For what value of z is the field maximum?

(b) Make a rough sketch of the equipotential curves everywhere in space (or rather, everywhere in a plane containing the z axis; you can represent the ring by two dots where it intersects the plane). Be sure to indicate what the curves look like very close to and very far from the ring, and how the transition from close to far occurs.

(c) There is a particular z value (along with its negative) at which the equipotentials make the transition from concave up to concave down. Explain why this z value equals the z value you found in part (a). Hint: The divergence of E is zero.
