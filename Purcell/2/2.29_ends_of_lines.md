## Problem Statement
Explain why electrostatic field lines can't form closed loops, and why their ends must be located either at charges or at infinity.

## Solution
 What's a field line? a curve $\gamma(t)$ s.t
$\forall t \quad \gamma'(t) = E(\gamma(t))$

Say it forms a closed loop, ie $\gamma(0) = \gamma(t_0)$.
On one hand from $E = \nabla \phi$

$\int E \cdot d\gamma = \phi(\gamma(t_0)) - \phi(\gamma(0)) = 0$

On the other Hand $\int E \cdot d\gamma = \int_0^{t_0} E(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma'(t) dt= \int_0^{t_0} |\gamma'(t)|^2 dt > 0$

As to why an end must be located at a charge or at infinity...
