## Problem Statement
A square sheet has uniform surface charge density σ. Letting the electric potential φ be zero at infinite distance from the square, denote by $φ_0$ the potential at the center of the square and by $φ_1$ the potential at a corner. Determine the ratio $φ_0/φ_1$. The answer can be found with very little calculation by combining a dimensional argument with superposition. (Think about the potential at the center of a square with the same charge density and with twice the edge length.)
