## Problem Statement
A spherical shell with radius R and surface charge density σ is sandwiched between two infinite sheets with surface charge densities -σ and σ, as shown in Fig. 2.46. If the potential far to the right at x = +∞ is taken to be zero, what is the potential at the center of the sphere? At x = -∞?
