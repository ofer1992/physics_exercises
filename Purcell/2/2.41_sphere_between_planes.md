## Problem Statement
A spherical shell with radius R and surface charge density σ is sandwiched between two infinite sheets with surface charge densities -σ and σ, as shown in Fig. 2.46. If the potential far to the right at x = +∞ is taken to be zero, what is the potential at the center of the sphere? At x = -∞?

## Solution

outside the planes the only field is from the sphere. If we start for away we can get close to the planes by following an orbit without work. since were far from the sphere it's field there will be parallel to the planes, so by crossing the planes perpendicularly we only need tu consider the field from the planes. The work to cross it is $\sigma / \epsilon_0 \cdot 2R$. Similarly we can get to $-\infty$ with zero work, so that's the potential there and at $x=0$ it's half of that in addition to the potential of the sphere.
