## Problem Statement
Consider the system of two charges shown in Fig. 2.8. Let z be the coordinate along the line on which the two charges lie, with z = 0 at the location of the positive charge. Make a plot of the potential φ (or rather $4π\epsilon_0φ$, for simplicity) along this line, from z = -5 m to z = 15 m.
