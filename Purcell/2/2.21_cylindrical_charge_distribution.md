## Problem Statement
A distribution of charge has cylindrical symmetry. As a function of the distance r from the symmetry axis, the electric potential is

$$φ(r) = \begin{cases}
3ρ_0R^2/4\epsilon_0 & \text{(for } r ≤ R\text{)} \\
ρ_0(4R^2 - r^2)/4\epsilon_0 & \text{(for } R < r < 2R\text{)} \\
0 & \text{(for } 2R ≤ r\text{)}
\end{cases}$$

where $ρ_0$ is a quantity with the dimensions of volume charge density.

(a) Find (and make rough plots of) the electric field and charge distribution, for all values of r. The derivative operators in cylindrical coordinates are listed in Appendix F.

(b) From your charge distribution, calculate the total charge per unit length along the cylinder.
