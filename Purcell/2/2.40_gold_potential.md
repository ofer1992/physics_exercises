## Problem Statement
As a distribution of electric charge, the gold nucleus can be described as a sphere of radius 6·10$^{-15}$ m with a charge Q = 79e distributed fairly uniformly through its interior. What is the potential $φ_0$ at the center of the nucleus, expressed in megavolts? (First derive a general formula for $φ_0$ for a sphere of charge Q and radius a. Do this by using Gauss's law to find the internal and external electric field and then integrating to find the potential. You should redo this here, even though it was done in an example in the text.)
