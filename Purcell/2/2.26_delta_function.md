## Problem Statement
In spherical coordinates, consider the Laplacian of the function f(r) = 1/r, that is, $∇^2(1/r)$. From Appendix F we have $∇^2f = (1/r^2)(∂/∂r)(r^2 ∂f/∂r)$ for a function that depends only on r. Since $r^2 ∂(1/r)/∂r$ takes on the constant value of −1, we see that $∇^2(1/r)$ equals zero. Well, almost. It is certainly zero for r ≠ 0, but we must be careful at the origin, due to the infinite $1/r^2$ factor out front.

Show that $∇^2(1/r)$ is not equal to zero at r = 0. Do this by showing that it is large enough (or more precisely, infinite enough) to make the volume integral $∫ ∇^2(1/r) dv$ equal to −4π, provided that the volume contains the origin. The divergence theorem will be helpful.
