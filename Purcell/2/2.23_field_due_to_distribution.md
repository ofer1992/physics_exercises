## Problem Statement
Each of the objects described below has uniform volume charge density ρ. There are no other charges present in addition to the given object. In each case use $∇ · E = ρ/\epsilon_0$ to show that the electric field takes the stated form.

(a) A rectangular slab has thickness in the x direction and infinite extent in the y and z directions. Show that $E_x = ρx/\epsilon_0$ inside the slab, where x is measured from the midplane of the slab.

(b) An infinitely long cylinder has radius R. Show that $E_r = ρr/2\epsilon_0$ inside the cylinder.

(c) A sphere has radius R. Show that $E_r = ρr/3\epsilon_0$ inside the sphere.

(d) Given that the above three setups all involve the same charge density and the same relation $∇ · E = ρ/\epsilon_0$, why do they give different results for the electric field?
