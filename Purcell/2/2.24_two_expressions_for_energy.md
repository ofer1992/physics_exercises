## Problem Statement
(a) Prove the identity

$$∇ · (φE) = (∇φ) · E + φ ∇ · E$$

by explicitly calculating the various derivatives in Cartesian coordinates.

(b) This identity holds for any scalar function φ and any vector function E. In particular, it holds for the electric potential and field. Use this fact to show that Eqs. (1.53) and (2.32) are equivalent expressions for the energy stored in a charge distribution of finite extent. You will want to apply the divergence theorem with a wisely chosen volume.
