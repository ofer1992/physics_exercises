## Problem Statement
It is arbitrary which of the two boxed statements in Section 2.1 we regard as the corollary of the other. Show that, if the line integral $\int E \cdot ds$ is zero around any closed path, it follows that the line integral between two different points is path-independent.

## Solution 

Take two paths between two points. The line integral on each path is equal if they're difference is 0. The negative of the integral of one path is equivalent or equal to the integral of the reverse path. The two paths now consist of a closed loop and the and the sum of the integrals is equal to the integral over the loop which is zero. q e d
