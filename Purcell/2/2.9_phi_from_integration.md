## Problem Statement
(a) A solid sphere has radius R and uniform volume charge density ρ. Find the potential at the center by evaluating the integral in Eq. (2.18).

(b) A spherical shell has radius R and uniform surface charge density σ. Find the potential at a point on the surface by evaluating the integral in Eq. (2.18).

(c) When written in terms of the total charge involved, how do the above two results compare?
