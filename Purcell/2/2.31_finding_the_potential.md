## Problem Statement
The following vector function represents a possible electrostatic field:

$E_x = 6xy$, $E_y = 3x^2 - 3y^2$, $E_z = 0$

(We have ignored a multiplicative factor with units of V/m$^3$ necessary to make the units correct.) Calculate the line integral of E from the point (0, 0, 0) to the point $(x_1, y_1, 0)$ along the path that runs straight from (0, 0, 0) to $(x_1, 0, 0)$ and thence to $(x_1, y_1, 0)$. Make a similar calculation for the path that runs along the other two sides of the rectangle, via the point $(0, y_1, 0)$. You ought to get the same answer if the assertion above is true. Now you have the potential function Ï†(x, y, z). Take the gradient of this function and see that you get back the components of the given field.
