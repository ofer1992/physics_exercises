## Problem Statement
Use the technique from the second example in Section 2.6 to calculate the potential at the center of a sheet in the shape of a regular N-gon with surface charge density σ. Let the distance from the center to the midpoint of a side be a. Show that your answer reduces to the result in Eq. (2.27) in the $N → ∞$ limit.
