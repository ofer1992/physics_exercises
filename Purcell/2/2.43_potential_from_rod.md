## Problem Statement
A thin rod extends along the z axis from z = -d to z = d. The rod carries a charge uniformly distributed along its length with linear charge density Î». By integrating over this charge distribution, calculate the potential at a point $P_1$ on the z axis with coordinates (0, 0, 2d). By another integration find the potential at a general point $P_2$ on the x axis and locate this point to make the potential equal to the potential at $P_1$.
