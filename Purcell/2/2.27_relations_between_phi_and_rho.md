## Problem Statement
Figure 2.29 gives two relations between φ and ρ, namely $φ = (1/4π\epsilon_0) ∫ (ρ/r) dv'$ and $∇^2φ = -ρ/\epsilon_0$. Show that these relations are consistent, by operating on the first one with the Laplacian $∇^2$ operator. Be careful that there are two types of coordinates in the equation, primed and unprimed; it can be written more precisely as

$$φ(r) = \frac{1}{4π\epsilon_0}∫ \frac{ρ(r')}{|r' - r|} dv'$$

You will want to solve Problem 2.26 first.
