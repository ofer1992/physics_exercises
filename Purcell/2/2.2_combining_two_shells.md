## Problem Statement
We know from Problem 1.32 that the self-energy of a spherical shell of radius R with charge Q uniformly distributed over it is $Q^2/8\pi\epsilon_0R$. What if we put two such shells right on top of each other, to make a shell with charge 2Q? Since we now just have two copies of the original system, it seems like the energy should be twice as large, or $Q^2/4\pi\epsilon_0R$. However, the above formula gives an energy of $(2Q)^2/8\pi\epsilon_0R = Q^2/2\pi\epsilon_0R$. Which answer is correct, and what is wrong with the reasoning for the wrong answer?
