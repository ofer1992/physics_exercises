## Problem Statement
Designate the corners of a square, on a side, in clockwise order, A, B, C, D. Put charges 2q at A and -3q at B. Determine the value of the line integral of E, from point C to point D. (No actual integration needed!) What is the numerical answer if q = 10$^{-9}$ C and â„“ = 5 cm?
