## Problem Statement
Find (and make rough plots of) the electric field and charge distribution associated with the following potential:

$$φ(x) = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{(for } x < 0\text{)} \\
ρ_0x^2/2\epsilon_0 & \text{(for } 0 < x < \ell\text{)} \\
ρ_0\ell^2/2\epsilon_0 & \text{(for } \ell < x\text{)}
\end{cases}$$
