## Problem Statement
By means of a Van de Graaff generator, protons are accelerated through a potential difference of 5Â·10$^6$ volts. The proton beam then passes through a thin silver foil. The atomic number of silver is 47, and you may assume that a silver nucleus is so massive compared with the proton that its motion may be neglected. What is the closest possible distance of approach, of any proton, to a silver nucleus? What will be the strength of the electric field acting on the proton at that position? What will be the proton's acceleration?
