## Problem Statement
Two point charges of strength 2q each and two point charges of strength −q each are symmetrically located in the xy plane as follows. The two positive charges are at (0, 2ℓ) and (0, −2ℓ), the two negative charges are at (ℓ, 0) and (−ℓ, 0). Some of the equipotentials in the xy plane have been plotted in Fig. 2.42. (Of course these curves are really the intersection of some three-dimensional equipotential surfaces with the xy plane.)

Study this figure until you understand its general appearance. Now find the value of the potential φ on each of the curves A, B, and C, as usual taking φ = 0 at infinite distance. Curve A has been arbitrarily chosen to cross the y axis at y = ℓ, and it can be shown (how?) that curve B crosses the x axis at x ≈ (3.44)ℓ. Roughly sketch some intermediate equipotentials.
