## Problem Statement
Consider the electric field E due to an infinite straight wire with uniform linear charge density Î». In Section 1.12 we found E by direct integration of Coulomb's law, and again by using Gauss's law. Find E here by calculating the potential and then taking the derivative.

You will find that the potential (relative to infinity) due to an infinite wire diverges. But you can get around this difficulty by instead finding the potential due to a very long but finite wire of length 2L, at a point lying on its perpendicular bisecting plane. Use a Taylor series to simplify your result, and then take the derivative to find E. Explain why this procedure is valid, even though it cuts off an infinite amount from the potential.
