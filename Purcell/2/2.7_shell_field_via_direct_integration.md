## Problem Statement
Consider the electric field E due to a spherical shell of radius R with charge Q uniformly distributed over its surface. In Section 1.11 we found E by using Gauss's law. Find E here (both inside and outside the shell) by directly calculating the potential at a given value of r by integrating the contributions from the different parts of the shell, and then using $E_r = -dÏ†/dr$. The simplest strategy is to slice the shell into rings, as shown in Fig. 2.43.

You will need to use the law of cosines.
