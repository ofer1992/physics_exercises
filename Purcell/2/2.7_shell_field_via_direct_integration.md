## Problem Statement
Consider the electric field E due to a spherical shell of radius R with charge Q uniformly distributed over its surface. In Section 1.11 we found E by using Gauss's law. Find E here (both inside and outside the shell) by directly calculating the potential at a given value of r by integrating the contributions from the different parts of the shell, and then using $E_r = -dÏ†/dr$. The simplest strategy is to slice the shell into rings, as shown in Fig. 2.43.

You will need to use the law of cosines.

## Solution 

# Slicing to Rings

$$\sigma = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon R^2}$$

Area of ring is $2\pi R\sin\phi\, Rd\phi$

Verifying:
$$
\int_0^\pi 2\pi R^2\sin\phi\,d\phi = 2\pi R^2[-\cos\phi]_0^\pi = 4\pi R^2
$$

Now we want to calculate the potential of the ring at r.

Let's consider a ring in general. At position $\vec{r}$, the potential is:

$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_{ring}}{\sqrt{x^2 + R^2}}
$$

In our case:
$$
x = r - R\cos\phi,\ 
R' = R\sin\phi
$$

So we get:
$$
\frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_{ring}}{\sqrt{r^2 - 2rR\cos\phi + R^2\cos^2\phi + R^2\sin^2\phi}}
$$

$$
= \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q_{ring}}{\sqrt{r^2 + R^2 - 2rR\cos\phi}}
$$

Plugging $Q_{ring}$ back:
$$
Q_{ring} = 2\pi R^2\sin\phi\,d\phi \cdot \frac{Q}{4\pi R^2} = \frac{1}{2}Q\sin\phi\,d\phi
$$

$$
\phi_{ring} = \frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0}Q\sin\phi(r^2 + R^2 - 2rR\cos\phi)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\,d\phi
$$


Integration gives:

$$
\int_0^\pi \frac{1}{8\pi\epsilon_0}Q\sin\phi(r^2 + R^2 - 2rR\cos\phi)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\,d\phi = \frac{Q}{8\pi\epsilon_0 rR}\left[\sqrt{(r+R)^2} - \sqrt{(r-R)^2}\right]
$$

$$
= \frac{Q}{8\pi\epsilon_0 rR}\left[(2r) \text{ or } (2R)\right]
$$

There are a couple of solutions here:
$$
\phi = \frac{Q}{8\pi\epsilon_0 rR}[(2r) \text{ or } (2R)]
$$

It makes more sense to have an r dependency i.e.
$$
\phi = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r}
$$

which is indeed correct. But how to justify?

Hmm, so if we remember that it's the law of cosines then the sqrt relates to a length, the length of the third side when $\phi = 0,\pi$. Both are degenerate triangles but when $\phi = 0$ then length is $r-R$ and at $\phi = \pi$ it's $r+R$ and the difference is then $2R$ which is the physical solution.

This treatment was for $r > R$. What about $r < R$?

The math stays the same, but how we should get a constant solution, then $E = -\nabla\phi = 0$

In the argument above, now at $\phi = 0$ the length is $R-r$ instead, so we get:

$$
\frac{Q}{8\pi\epsilon_0 rR}[R+r-(R-r)] = \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 R}
$$
