## Problem Statement
Suppose eight protons are permanently fixed at the corners of a cube. A ninth proton floats freely near the center of the cube. There are no other charges around, and no gravity. Is the ninth proton trapped? Can it find an escape route that is all downhill in potential energy? Feel free to analyze this numerically/graphically.
