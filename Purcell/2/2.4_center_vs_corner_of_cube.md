## Problem Statement
Consider a charge distribution that has the constant density ρ everywhere inside a cube of edge b and is zero everywhere outside that cube. Letting the electric potential φ be zero at infinite distance from the cube of charge, denote by $φ_0$ the potential at the center of the cube and by $φ_1$ the potential at a corner of the cube. Determine the ratio $φ_0/φ_1$. The answer can be found with very little calculation by combining a dimensional argument with superposition. (Think about the potential at the center of a cube with the same charge density and with twice the edge length.)
