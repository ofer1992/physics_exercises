## Problem Statement
Consider a charge distribution that has the constant density ρ everywhere inside a cube of edge b and is zero everywhere outside that cube. Letting the electric potential φ be zero at infinite distance from the cube of charge, denote by $φ_0$ the potential at the center of the cube and by $φ_1$ the potential at a corner of the cube. Determine the ratio $φ_0/φ_1$. The answer can be found with very little calculation by combining a dimensional argument with superposition. (Think about the potential at the center of a cube with the same charge density and with twice the edge length.)

## Solution

### First Relationship
Consider a cube with edge 2b. We can think of this as being made up of 8 smaller cubes, each with edge b. Due to the principle of superposition, the potential is additive. Therefore, at any point, the total potential is the sum of contributions from each smaller cube.

When we look at the potential in the middle of the bigger cube, it equals 8 times the potential that would be created by the smaller cubes at their vertices. This gives us our first relationship:

$$\phi_0(2b) = 8\phi_1(b)$$

### Second Relationship - Scaling Analysis
Consider what happens when we take a cube and enlarge it to twice its size while keeping the total charge fixed. This effectively "stretches" the charge distribution. We can analyze this through the following steps:

1. For any infinitesimal charge element (since the total potential is the integral of contributions from all charge elements):
   - When we stretch the cube by a factor of 2, each charge element is now twice as far from the center
   - Since potential goes as $\frac{1}{r}$, each charge element's contribution is halved

2. For the case of constant charge density (the actual problem):
   - Start with the stretched cube (twice the size, half the potential)
   - To get the same charge density as original, multiply by 8 (as volume increased by factor of 8)
   - Therefore, the potential is quadrupled (half × 8 = 4)

This gives us our second relationship:

$$\phi_0(2b) = 4\phi_0(b)$$

### Final Result
Putting these relationships together:

$$\frac{\phi_0(b)}{\phi_1(b)} = 2$$

This solution follows from combining our understanding of how potential scales with distance ($\frac{1}{r}$ dependence) and the effect of charge density scaling in three dimensions.
