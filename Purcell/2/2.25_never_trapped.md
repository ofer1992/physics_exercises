## Problem Statement
A number of positive point charges, with various magnitudes, are located at fixed positions in space. Show that no matter where an additional positive charge q is placed, there exists an escape route to infinity that is all downhill in potential energy. The "impossibility theorem" discussed in Section 2.12 will be helpful, but that deals only with small displacements, so you will need to extend the argument.
