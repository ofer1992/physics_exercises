## Problem Statement
(a) A spherical shell with charge Q uniformly distributed throughout its volume has inner radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$. Calculate (and make a rough plot of) the electric field as a function of r, for $0 ≤ r ≤ ∞$.

(b) What is the potential at the center of the shell? You can let $R_2 = 2R_1$ in this part of the problem, to keep things from getting too messy. Give your answer in terms of $R ≡ R_1$.

## Solution 
(a) 

$$Q = \frac{4}{3}\pi(R_2^3 - R_1^3)\rho$$

$$\rho = \frac{3Q}{4\pi(R_2^3 - R_1^3)}$$

We can view this shell as many infinitesimally thin shells, and use our previous findings, that inside the shell the field is zero, and outside the field acts as if the charge is concentrated in a point charge in the middle.

$$
E(r) = \begin{cases}
0 & r \leq R_1 \\
\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{(r^3-R_1^3)}{r^2(R_2^3-R_1^3)} & R_1 \leq r \leq R_2 \\
\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r^2} & R_2 \leq r
\end{cases}
$$

(b) Since E = 0 inside the shell, the potential at the center is the potential at the inner face.

Reminder: $$E = -\nabla\phi$$
### Wrong derivation

Since E is radial we can just integrate it:

$$
\begin{align*}
\int_{∞}^R -E_r dr &= \int_{∞}^R -\frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r^2}dr + \int_{2R}^R \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{r^2-R}{R r^2}dr \\
&= \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left[\frac{1}{r}\right]_{∞}^{2R} + \int_R^{2R}\left(-\frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{r^2}\right)dr \\
&= \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{2R} + \frac{-1}{R}(R-2R) + \left[-\frac{1}{r}\right]_{2R}^R\right) \\
&= \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\left(\frac{1}{2R} + 1 - \frac{1}{R} + \frac{1}{2R}\right) \\
&= \frac{Q}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot 1
\end{align*}
$$

### correct derivation
Okay, I might be wrong, so let's try another method. The total potential should be the sum of potentials at R from the infinitesimal shells.

$$\phi(R) = \int_R^{2R} \phi_r(R)$$

where $\phi_r$is the potential from sphere of radius r

$$
\begin{align*}
\phi_r(R) &= \phi_r(r) \\
&= \frac{dq}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r} \\
&= \frac{\rho 4\pi r^2 dr}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{r} \\
&= \frac{\rho r dr}{\epsilon_0}
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{align*}
\phi(R) &= \int_R^{2R} \frac{\rho r}{\epsilon_0}dr = \frac{\rho}{\epsilon_0}\left[\frac{1}{2}r^2\right]_R^{2R} \\
&= \frac{\rho}{2\epsilon_0}((2R)^2-R^2) \\
&= \frac{\rho}{2\epsilon_0}(4R^2-R^2)
\end{align*}
$$

Plugging $\rho$ back we get

$$\phi(R) = \frac{3Q}{4\pi(2R^3-R^3)}\cdot((2R)^2-R^2)/2\epsilon_0 = \frac{q}{56\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{1}{R}$$

Note: The R's in Q were at first accidentally squared instead of cubed. One way to catch it was to check that the formula reduces to the familiar cases. Something to learn from.
