## Problem Statement
(a) A spherical shell with charge Q uniformly distributed throughout its volume has inner radius $R_1$ and outer radius $R_2$. Calculate (and make a rough plot of) the electric field as a function of r, for $0 ≤ r ≤ ∞$.

(b) What is the potential at the center of the shell? You can let $R_2 = 2R_1$ in this part of the problem, to keep things from getting too messy. Give your answer in terms of $R ≡ R_1$.
