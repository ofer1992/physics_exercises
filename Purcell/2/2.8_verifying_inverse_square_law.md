## Problem Statement
As mentioned in Section 1.4, Cavendish and Maxwell conducted experiments to test the inverse-square nature of Coulomb's law. This problem gives the theory behind their experiments.

(a) Assume that Coulomb's law takes the form of $kq_1q_2/r^{2+δ}$. Given a hollow spherical shell with radius R and uniformly distributed charge Q, show that the potential at radius r is (with $f(x) = x^{1-δ}$ and $k ≡ 1/4π\epsilon_0$)

$$φ(r) = \frac{kQ}{2(1 - δ^2)rR}[f(R + r) - f(R - r)] \text{ (for r < R)},$$

$$φ(r) = \frac{kQ}{2(1 - δ^2)rR}[f(R + r) - f(r - R)] \text{ (for r > R)}.$$

The calculation requires only a slight modification of the analogous direct calculation (that is, one that doesn't use the Gauss's-law shortcut) of the potential in the case of the standard Coulomb $1/r^2$ law; see Problem 2.7.

Note: We are usually concerned with $δ ≪ 1$, in which case the $(1 - δ^2)$ factor in the denominators in Eq. (2.113) can be reasonably approximated by 1. We will ignore it for the remainder of this problem.

(b) Consider two concentric shells with radii a and b (with a > b) and uniformly distributed charges $Q_a$ and $Q_b$. Show that the potentials on the shells are given by

$$φ_a = \frac{kQ_a}{2a^2}f(2a) + \frac{kQ_b}{2ab}[f(a + b) - f(a - b)],$$

$$φ_b = \frac{kQ_b}{2b^2}f(2b) + \frac{kQ_a}{2ab}[f(a + b) - f(a - b)].$$

(c) Show that if the shells are connected, so that they are at the same potential φ, then the charge on the inner shell is

$$Q_b = \frac{2bφ}{k} \cdot \frac{bf(2a) - a[f(a + b) - f(a - b)]}{f(2a)f(2b) - [f(a + b) - f(a - b)]^2}.$$

If $δ = 0$ so that $f(x) = x$, then $Q_b$ equals zero, as it should. So if $Q_b$ is measured to be nonzero, then δ must be nonzero.

For small δ it is possible to expand $Q_b$ to first order in δ by using the approximation $f(x) = xe^{-δ \ln x} ≈ x(1 - δ \ln x)$, but this gets very messy. You are encouraged instead to use a computer to calculate and plot $Q_b$ for various values of a, b, and δ. You can also trivially expand $Q_b$ to first order in δ by using the Series operation in Mathematica.
