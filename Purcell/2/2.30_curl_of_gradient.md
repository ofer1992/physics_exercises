## Problem Statement
The electric field equals the negative gradient of the potential, that is, $E = -∇φ$. Show that this implies that the curl of E, which we can write as $∇ × E$, is identically zero. Do this by:

(a) calculating $∇ × ∇φ$ in Cartesian coordinates;
(b) making judicious use of Stokes' theorem.
