## Problem Statement
A charge of 2 C is located at the origin. Two charges of -1 C each are located at the points (1, 1, 0) and (-1, 1, 0). If the potential φ is taken to be zero at infinity (as usual), then it is easy to see that φ is also zero at the point (0, 1, 0). It follows that somewhere on the y axis beyond (0, 1, 0) the function φ(0, y, 0) must have a minimum or a maximum. At that point the electric field E must be zero. Why? Locate the point, at least approximately.
