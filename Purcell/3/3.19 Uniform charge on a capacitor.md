## Problem Statement
Problem 3.4 shows that the charge distribution on an isolated conducting disk is not uniform. But when two oppositely charged disks (or any other planar shape) are placed very close to each other to form a capacitor, the charge distribution on each is essentially uniform, assuming the separation is small. Can you prove this?
