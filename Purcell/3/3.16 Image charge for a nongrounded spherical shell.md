## Problem Statement
A charge Q is located a distance r > R from the center of a nongrounded conducting spherical shell with radius R and total charge $q_s$. The field external to the shell can be mimicked by the combination of the image charge discussed in Problem 3.13, plus a second image charge. What is this second charge, and where is it located?
