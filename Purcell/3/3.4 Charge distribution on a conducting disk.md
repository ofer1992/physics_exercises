## Problem Statement
There is a very sneaky way of finding the charge distribution on a conducting circular disk with radius R and charge Q. Our goal is to find a charge distribution such that the electric field at any point in the disk has zero component parallel to the disk. From Problem 1.17 we know that the field at any point P inside a spherical shell with uniform surface charge density is zero. Consider the projection of this shell onto the equatorial plane containing P. Explain why this setup is relevant, and use it to find the desired charge density on a conducting disk.
