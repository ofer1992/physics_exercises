## Problem Statement
In the setup in Problem 3.9, let the inner shell be grounded by connecting it to a large conducting neutral object very far away via a very thin wire that passes through a very small hole in the outer shell. If you think in terms of potentials (as you probably did if you solved Problem 3.9), then you can quickly see why some of the charge on the inner shell flows off to infinity. The potential of the inner shell is initially higher than the potential at infinity.

However, if you think in terms of forces on the positive charges on the inner shell, then things aren't as clear. A small bit of positive charge will certainly want to hop on the wire and follow the electric field across the gap to the larger shell. But when it gets to the larger shell, it seems like it has no reason to keep going to infinity, because the field is zero outside. And, even worse, the field will point inward once some positive charge has moved away from the shells. So it seems like the field will drag back any positive charge that has left. What's going on? Does charge actually leave the inner shell? If so, what is wrong with the above reasoning?
