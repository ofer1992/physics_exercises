## Problem Statement
Make a rough estimate of the capacitance of an isolated human body. (Hint: It must lie somewhere between that of an inscribed sphere and that of a circumscribed sphere.) By shuffling over a nylon rug on a dry winter day, you can easily charge yourself up to a couple of kilovolts â€“ as shown by the length of the spark when your hand comes too close to a grounded conductor. How much energy would be dissipated in such a spark?
