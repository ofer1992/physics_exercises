## Problem Statement
Consider a point on the surface of a conductor. The principal radii of curvature of the surface at that point are defined to be the largest and smallest radii of curvature there. To find the radii of curvature, consider a plane that contains the normal to the surface at the given point. Rotate this plane around the normal, and look at the curve representing the intersection of the plane and the surface. The radius of curvature is defined to be the radius of the circle that locally matches up with the curve. For example, a sphere has its principal radii everywhere equal to the radius R. A cylinder has one principal radius equal to the cross-sectional radius R, and the other equal to infinity.

It turns out that the spatial derivative (in the direction of the normal) of the electric field just outside a conductor can be written in terms of the principal radii, $R_1$ and $R_2$, as follows:

$$
\frac{dE}{dx} = -\left(\frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}\right)E
$$

(a) Verify this expression for a sphere, a cylinder, and a plane.

(b) Prove this expression. Use Gauss's law with a wisely chosen pillbox just outside the surface. Remember that near the surface, the electric field is normal to it.

## Solution

### Thoughts
- Figure out how curvature is defined, as a limit of what.
- use the pillbox for the derivative 
	- maybe one face just on the surface and another a little in and look at limit
	- can I express $dA$ with Taylor?
