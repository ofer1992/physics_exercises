## Problem Statement
A parallel-plate capacitor consists of a fixed plate and a movable plate that is allowed to slide in the direction parallel to the plates. Let x be the distance of overlap, as shown in Fig. 3.28. The separation between the plates is fixed.

(a) Assume that the plates are electrically isolated, so that their charges ±Q are constant. In terms of Q and the (variable) capacitance C, derive an expression for the leftward force on the movable plate. Hint: Consider how the energy of the system changes with x.

(b) Now assume that the plates are connected to a battery, so that the potential difference φ is held constant. In terms of φ and the capacitance C, derive an expression for the force.

(c) If the movable plate is held in place by an opposing force, then either of the above two setups could be the relevant one, because nothing is moving. So the forces in (a) and (b) should be equal. Verify that this is the case.
