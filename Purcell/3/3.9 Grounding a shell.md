## Problem Statement
A conducting spherical shell has charge Q and radius $R_1$. A larger concentric conducting spherical shell has charge âˆ’Q and radius $R_2$. If the outer shell is grounded, explain why nothing happens to the charge on it. If instead the inner shell is grounded, find its final charge.
