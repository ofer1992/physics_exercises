## Problem Statement
If we put some charge in a 3D conducting ball, it all heads to the surface; the volume charge density is zero inside. If we put some charge on a 2D conducting "ball" (that is, a disk), then we found in Problem 3.4 that the resulting surface charge density is nonzero throughout the disk, but that it increases toward the edge. If we put some charge on a 1D conducting "ball" (that is, a stick), then it turns out that the same strategy used in Problem 3.4 can be used to show that the resulting linear charge density on the stick is essentially uniform; see Good (1997). At first glance, this seems absurd, because if we consider a little piece of charge at an off-center position, there is more charge on one side than on the other. So the electric field at the little piece isn't zero, as we know it must be in a conductor.

Your task is to explain what is meant by the above phrase, essentially uniform, by considering a setup with a very large number N of point charges, each with initial value Q/N, that are evenly spaced on the stick, a fixed small distance L/N apart. Determine roughly (in an order-of-magnitude sense) how much charge needs to be added to an adjacent point charge so that the field felt by a given off-center point charge is zero. Then take the N → ∞ limit. Consider the cases where the given point charge is, or isn't, very close to an end. (This problem is partly quantitative and partly qualitative. Feel free to drop all factors of order 1 and just look at the dependence of various quantities on the given parameters, in particular N.)
