## Problem Statement
Given that the capacitance of an isolated conducting disk of radius a is $8\epsilon_0a$, what is the energy stored in the electric field of such a disk when the net charge on the disk is Q? Compare this with the energy in the field of a nonconducting disk of the same radius that has an equal charge Q distributed with uniform density over its surface. (See Exercise 2.56.) Which ought to be larger? Why?
