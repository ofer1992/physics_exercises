## Problem Statement
We want to design a spherical vacuum capacitor, with a given radius a for the outer spherical shell, that will be able to store the greatest amount of electrical energy subject to the constraint that the electric field strength at the surface of the inner sphere may not exceed $E_0$. What radius b should be chosen for the inner spherical conductor, and how much energy can be stored?
