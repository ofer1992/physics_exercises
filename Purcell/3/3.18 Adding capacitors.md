## Problem Statement
(a) Two capacitors, $C_1$ and $C_2$, are connected in series, as shown in Fig. 3.27(a). Show that the effective capacitance C of the system is given by

$$
\frac{1}{C} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2}
$$

Check the $C_1$ → 0 and $C_1$ → ∞ limits.

(b) If the capacitors are instead connected in parallel, as shown in Fig. 3.27(b), show that the effective capacitance is given by

$$
C = C_1 + C_2
$$

Again check the $C_1$ → 0 and $C_1$ → ∞ limits.

These two rules are the opposites of the rules for adding resistors (see Problem 4.3) and inductors (see Problem 7.13).
