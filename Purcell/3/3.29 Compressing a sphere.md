## Problem Statement
A spherical conducting shell has radius R and potential φ. If you want, you can consider it to be part of a capacitor with the other shell at infinity. You compress the shell down to essentially zero size (always keeping it spherical) while a battery holds the potential constant at φ. By calculating the initial and final energies stored in the system, and also the work done by (or on) you and the battery, verify that energy is conserved. (Be sure to specify clearly what your conservation-of-energy statement is, paying careful attention to the signs of the various quantities.)
