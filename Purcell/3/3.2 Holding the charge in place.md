## Problem Statement
The two metal spheres in Fig. 3.23(a) are connected by a wire; the total charge is zero. In Fig. 3.23(b) two oppositely charged conducting spheres have been brought into the positions shown, inducing charges of opposite sign in A and in B. If now C and D are connected by a wire as in Fig. 3.23(c), it could be argued that something like the charge distribution in Fig. 3.23(b) ought to persist, each charge concentration being held in place by the attraction of the opposite charge nearby. What about that? Can you prove it won't happen?
