## Problem Statement
N charged raindrops with radius a all have the same potential. Assume that they are far enough apart so that the charge distribution on each isn't affected by the others (that is, it is spherically symmetric). What is the total capacitance of this system? How does this capacitance compare with the capacitance in the case where the drops are combined into one big drop?
