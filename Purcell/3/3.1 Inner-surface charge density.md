## Problem Statement
A positive point charge q is located off-center inside a conducting spherical shell, as shown in Fig. 3.22. (You can assume that the shell is neutral, although this doesn't matter.) We know from Gauss's law that the total charge on the inner surface of the shell is âˆ’q. Is the surface charge density negative over the entire inner surface? Or can it be positive on the far side of the inner surface if the point charge q is close enough to the shell so that it attracts enough negative charge to the near side? Justify your answer. Hint: Think about field lines.
