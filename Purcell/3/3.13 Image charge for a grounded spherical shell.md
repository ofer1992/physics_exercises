## Problem Statement
(a) A point charge −q is located at x = a, and a point charge Q is located at x = A. Show that the locus of points with φ = 0 is a circle in the xy plane (and hence a spherical shell in space).

(b) What must be the relation among q, Q, a, and A so that the center of the circle is located at x = 0?

(c) Assuming that the relation you found in part (b) holds, what is the radius of the circle in terms of a and A?

(d) Explain why the previous results imply the following statement: if a charge Q is externally located a distance A > R from the center of a grounded conducting spherical shell with radius R, then the external field due to the shell is the same as the field of an image point charge −q = −QR/A located a distance a = $R^2$/A from the center of the shell; see Fig. 3.25. The total external field is the sum of this field plus the field from Q. (The internal field is zero, by the uniqueness theorem.)

(e) Likewise for the following statement: if a charge −q is internally located a distance a < R from the center of a grounded conducting spherical shell with radius R, then the internal field due to the shell is the same as the field of an image point charge Q = qR/a located a distance A = $R^2$/a from the center of the shell; see Fig. 3.26. The total internal field is the sum of this field plus the field from q. (The external field is zero, because otherwise the shell would not have the same potential as infinity. Evidently a charge +q flows onto the grounded shell.)
