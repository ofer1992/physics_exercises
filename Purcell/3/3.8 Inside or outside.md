## Problem Statement
A setup consists of a spherical metal shell and a point charge q. We are interested in the electric field at a given point P. In Fig. 3.24(a), if the shell is placed in position A around point P, with the charge q outside, then we know that the field at P is zero by the uniqueness theorem. On the other hand, if the shell is placed in position B around the charge q, with point P outside, then we know that the field at P is nonzero (see the example in Section 3.2).

However, we can transition continuously from one of these cases to the other by increasing the size of shell A until the left part of it becomes an infinite plane between q and P, and then considering this plane to be the right part of an infinite shell B, and then shrinking this shell down to the given size. During this process the point P goes from being inside the shell to being outside. What's going on here? How can we transition from zero field to nonzero field at point P?
