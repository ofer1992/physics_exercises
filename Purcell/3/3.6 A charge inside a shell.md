## Problem Statement
Is the following reasoning correct or incorrect (if incorrect, state the error). A point charge q lies at an off-center position inside a conducting spherical shell. The surface of the conductor is at constant potential, so, by the uniqueness theorem, the potential is constant inside. The field inside is therefore zero, so the charge experiences no force.
