## Problem Statement
Repeat the three parts of Problem 3.26, but don't use the word "capacitance" in your solution. Instead find the stored energy by considering the energy density of the electric field. Write the force in terms of the overlap x, the separation s, the width of the plates (in the direction perpendicular to the page), and either the charge Q (for part (a)) or the density Ïƒ (for part (b)).
