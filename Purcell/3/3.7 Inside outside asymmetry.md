## Problem Statement
If a point charge is located outside a hollow conducting shell, there is an electric field outside, but no electric field inside. On the other hand, if a point charge is located inside a hollow conducting shell, there is an electric field both inside and outside (although the external field would be zero in the special case where the shell happened to have charge exactly equal and opposite to the point charge). The situation is therefore not symmetric with respect to inside and outside. Explain why this is the case, by considering where electric field lines can begin and end.
