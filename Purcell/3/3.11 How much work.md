## Problem Statement
A charge Q is located a distance h above a conducting plane, just as in Fig. 3.10(a). Asked to predict the amount of work that would have to be done to move this charge out to infinite distance from the plane, one student says that it is the same as the work required to separate to infinite distance two charges Q and âˆ’Q that are initially 2h apart, hence $W = Q^2/4\pi\epsilon_0(2h)$. Another student calculates the force that acts on the charge as it is being moved and integrates F dx, but gets a different answer. What did the second student get, and who is right?
