## Problem Statement
A capacitor consists of two arbitrarily shaped conducting shells, with one inside the other. The inner conductor has charge Q, the outer has charge −Q. We know of two ways of calculating the energy U stored in this system. We can find the electric field E and then integrate $\epsilon_0E^2/2$ over the volume between the conductors. Or if we know the potential difference φ, we can write U = Qφ/2 (or equivalently U = $Cφ^2$/2).

(a) Show that these two methods give the same energy in the case of two concentric shells.

(b) By using the identity ∇ · (φ∇φ) = (∇φ)$^2$ + φ ∇$^2$φ, show that the two methods give the same energy for conductors of any shape.
