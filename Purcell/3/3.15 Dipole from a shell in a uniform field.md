## Problem Statement
If a neutral conducting spherical shell with radius R is placed in a uniform electric field E, the charge on the shell will redistribute itself and create a sort of dipole.

(a) Show that the external field due to the redistributed charge on the shell is in fact exactly equal to the field due to an idealized dipole at the center of the shell. What is the strength p of the dipole?

(b) Using the form of the dipole field given in Eq. (2.36), verify that the total external field (E plus the field from the shell) is perpendicular to the shell at the surface.

(c) What is the surface charge density as a function of position on the shell?

Hint: Use the result from Problem 3.13, and consider the uniform field E to be generated by a charge Q at position x = −A, plus a charge −Q at position x = A. In the limit where both Q and A go to infinity (in an appropriate manner), the field at the location of the shell is finite, essentially uniform, and points in the positive x direction.
