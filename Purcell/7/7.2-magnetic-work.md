## Problem Statement
In Fig. 7.27 a conducting rod is pulled to the right at speed $v$ while maintaining contact with two rails. A magnetic field points into the page. From the reasoning in Section 7.3, we know that an induced emf will cause a current to flow in the counterclockwise direction around the loop. Now, the magnetic force $q\mathbf{u} \times \mathbf{B}$ is perpendicular to the velocity $\mathbf{u}$ of the moving charges, so it can't do work on them. However, the magnetic force $\mathbf{f}$ in Eq. (7.5) certainly looks like it is doing work. What's going on here? Is the magnetic force doing work or not? If not, then what is? There is definitely something doing work because the wire will heat up.
