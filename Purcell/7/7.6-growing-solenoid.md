## Problem Statement
An infinite solenoid has radius $R$ and $n$ turns per unit length. The current grows linearly with time, according to $I(t) = Ct$. Use the integral form of Faraday's law to find the electric field at radius $r$, both inside and outside the solenoid. Then verify that your answers satisfy the differential form of the law.
