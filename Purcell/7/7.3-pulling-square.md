## Problem Statement
A square wire frame with side length $\ell$ has total resistance $R$. It is being pulled with speed $v$ out of a region where there is a uniform $B$ field pointing out of the page (the shaded area in Fig. 7.28). Consider the moment when the left corner is a distance $x$ inside the shaded area.

a. What force do you need to apply to the square so that it moves with constant speed $v$?

b. Verify that the work you do from $x = x_0$ (which you can assume is less than $\ell/\sqrt{2}$) down to $x = 0$ equals the energy dissipated in the resistor.
