## Problem Statement
An ocean current flows at a speed of 2 knots (approximately 1 m/s) in a region where the vertical component of the earth's magnetic field is 0.35 gauss. The conductivity of seawater in that region is 4 (ohm-m)$^{-1}$. On the assumption that there is no other horizontal component of $E$ than the motional term $v \times B$, find the density $J$ of the horizontal electric current. If you were to carry a bottle of seawater through the earth's field at this speed, would such a current be flowing in it?
