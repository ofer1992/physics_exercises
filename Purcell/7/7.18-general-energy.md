## Problem Statement
The task of Problem 2.24 was to demonstrate that two different expressions for the electrostatic energy, $\int (\epsilon_0E^2/2) dv$ and $\int (\rho\phi/2) dv$, are equivalent (as they must be, if they are both valid). The latter expression can quickly be converted to $C\phi^2/2$ in the case of oppositely charged conductors in a capacitor (see Exercise 3.65). The task of this problem is to demonstrate the analogous relation for the magnetic energy, that is, to show that if a circuit (of finite extent) with self-inductance $L$ contains current $I$, then $\int (B^2/2\mu_0) dv$ equals $LI^2/2$. This is a bit trickier than the electrostatic case, so here are some hints: 
1. a useful vector identity is $\nabla \cdot (\mathbf{A} \times \mathbf{B}) = \mathbf{B} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{A}) - \mathbf{A} \cdot (\nabla \times \mathbf{B})$
2. the vector potential and magnetic field satisfy $\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \mathbf{B}$
3. $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \mu_0\mathbf{J}$
4. $\Phi = \int \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$ from Eq. (7.52)
5. $L$ is defined by $\Phi = LI$
