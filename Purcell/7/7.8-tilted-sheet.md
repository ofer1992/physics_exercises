## Problem Statement
Recall the "tilted sheet" example in Section 5.5, in which a charged sheet was tilted at 45Â° in the lab frame. We calculated the electric field in the frame $F'$ moving to the right with speed $v$ (which was $0.6c$ in the example). The goal of this problem is to demonstrate that Faraday's law holds in this setup.

![Moving tilted charged sheet]

a. For a general speed $v$, find the component of the electric field that is parallel to the sheet in frame $F'$ (in which the sheet moves to the left with speed $v$). If you solved Exercise 5.12, you've already done most of the work.

b. Use the Lorentz transformations to find the magnetic field in $F'$.

c. In $F'$, verify that $\int \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{s} = -d\Phi/dt$ holds for the rectangle shown in Fig. 7.30 (this rectangle is fixed in $F'$).
