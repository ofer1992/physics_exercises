## Problem Statement
a. Two inductors, $L_1$ and $L_2$, are connected in series, as shown in Fig. 7.32(a). Show that the effective inductance $L$ of the system is given by

$$L = L_1 + L_2$$

Check the $L_1 \to 0$ and $L_1 \to \infty$ limits.

b. If the inductors are instead connected in parallel, as shown in Fig. 7.32(b), show that the effective inductance is given by

$$\frac{1}{L} = \frac{1}{L_1} + \frac{1}{L_2}$$

Again check the $L_1 \to 0$ and $L_1 \to \infty$ limits.
