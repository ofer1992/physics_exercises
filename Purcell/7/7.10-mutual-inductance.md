## Problem Statement
In Section 7.7 we made use of the vector potential to prove that $M_{12} = M_{21}$. We can give a second proof, this time in the spirit of Exercise 3.64. Imagine increasing the currents in two circuits gradually from zero to the final values of $I_{1f}$ and $I_{2f}$ ("f" for "final"). Due to the induced emfs, some external agency has to supply power to increase (or maintain) the currents. The final currents can be brought about in many different ways. Two possible ways are of particular interest.

a. Keep $I_2$ at zero while raising $I_1$ gradually from zero to $I_{1f}$. Then raise $I_2$ from zero to $I_{2f}$ while holding $I_1$ constant at $I_{1f}$.

b. Carry out a similar program with the roles of 1 and 2 exchanged, that is, raise $I_2$ from zero to $I_{2f}$ first, and so on.

Compute the total work done by external agencies, for each of the two programs. Then complete the argument.
