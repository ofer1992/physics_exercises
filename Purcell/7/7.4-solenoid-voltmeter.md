## Problem Statement
We can think of a voltmeter as a device that registers the line integral $\int \mathbf{E} \cdot d\mathbf{s}$ along a path $C$ from the clip at the end of its (+) lead, through the voltmeter, to the clip at the end of its (−) lead. Note that part of $C$ lies inside the voltmeter itself. Path $C$ may also be part of a loop that is completed by some external path from the (−) clip to the (+) clip. With that in mind, consider the arrangement in Fig. 7.29. The solenoid is so long that its external magnetic field is negligible. Its cross-sectional area is 20 cm$^2$, and the field inside is toward the right and increasing at the rate of 100 gauss/s. Two identical voltmeters are connected to points on a loop that encloses the solenoid and contains two 50 ohm resistors, as shown. The voltmeters are capable of reading microvolts and have high internal resistance. What will each voltmeter read? Make sure your answer is consistent, from every point of view, with Eq. (7.26).
