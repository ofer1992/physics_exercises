## Problem Statement
Consider the RL circuit discussed in Section 7.9. Show that the energy delivered by the battery up to an arbitrary time $t$ equals the energy stored in the magnetic field plus the energy dissipated in the resistor. To do this, multiply Eq. (7.65) by $I$ to obtain $I^2R = I(E_0 - L dI/dt)$, and then integrate this equation.
