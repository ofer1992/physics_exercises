## Problem Statement
A long straight stationary wire is parallel to the y axis and passes through the point $z = h$ on the z axis. A current $I$ flows in this wire, returning by a remote conductor whose field we may neglect. Lying in the xy plane is a thin rectangular loop with two of its sides, of length $\ell$, parallel to the long wire. The length $b$ of the other two sides is very small. The loop slides with constant speed $v$ in the $\hat{x}$ direction. Find the magnitude of the electromotive force induced in the loop at the moment the center of the loop has position $x$. For what values of $x$ does this emf have a local maximum or minimum? (Work in the approximation where $b \ll x$, so that you can approximate the relevant difference in $B$ fields by a derivative.)
