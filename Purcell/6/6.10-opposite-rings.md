## Problem Statement
Two parallel rings have the same axis and are separated by a small distance Îµ. They have the same radius a, and they carry the same current I but in opposite directions. Consider the magnetic field at points on the axis of the rings. The field is zero midway between the rings, because the contributions from the rings cancel. And the field is zero very far away. So it must reach a maximum value at some point in between. Find this point. Work in the approximation where $$\epsilon \ll a$$.
