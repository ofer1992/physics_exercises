## Problem Statement
A charge q moves with speed v parallel to a wire with linear charge density λ (as measured in the lab frame). The charges in the wire move with speed u in the opposite direction, as shown in Fig. 6.38. If the charge q is a distance r from the wire, find the force on it in:
(a) the given lab frame
(b) its own rest frame
(c) the rest frame of the charges in the wire

Do this by calculating the electric and magnetic forces in the various frames. Then check that the force in the charge's rest frame relates properly to the forces in the other two frames. You can use the fact that the γ factor associated with the relativistic addition of u and v is $$\gamma_u \gamma_v (1 + \beta_u \beta_v)$$.
