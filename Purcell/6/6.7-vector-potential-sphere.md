## Problem Statement
A spherical shell with radius R and uniform surface charge density σ rotates with angular speed ω around the z axis. Calculate the vector potential at a point on the surface of the sphere. Do this in three steps as follows.

(a) By direct integration, calculate A at the point (R, 0, 0). You will want to slice the shell into rings whose points are equidistant from (R, 0, 0). The calculation isn't so bad once you realize that only one component of the velocity survives.

(b) Find A at the point (x, 0, z) in Fig. 6.34 by considering the setup to be the superposition of two shells rotating with the angular velocity vectors $$\omega_1$$ and $$\omega_2$$ shown. (This works because angular velocity vectors simply add.)

(c) Finally, determine A at a general point (x, y, z) on the surface of the sphere.
