## Problem Statement
A particle of charge q and rest mass m is moving with velocity v where the magnetic field is B. Here B is perpendicular to v, and there is no electric field. Show that the path of the particle is a curve with radius of curvature R given by $$R = p/qB$$, where p is the momentum of the particle, $$\gamma mv$$. (Hint: Note that the force $$qv \times B$$ can only change the direction of the momentum, not the magnitude. By what angle Î¸ is the direction of p changed in a short time $$\Delta t$$?) If B is the same everywhere, the particle will follow a circular path. Find the time required to complete one revolution.
