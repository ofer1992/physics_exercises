## Problem Statement
Show that the vector potential given by Eq. (6.44) satisfies $$\nabla \cdot A = 0$$, provided that the current is steady (that is, $$\nabla \cdot J = 0$$). Hints: Use the divergence theorem, and be careful about the two types of coordinates in Eq. (6.44) (the 1's and 2's). You will need to show that $$\nabla_1(1/r_{12}) = -\nabla_2(1/r_{12})$$, where the subscript denotes the set of coordinates with respect to which the derivative is taken. The vector identity $$\nabla \cdot (f F) = f \nabla \cdot F + F \cdot \nabla f$$ will come in handy.
