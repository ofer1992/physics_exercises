## Problem Statement
(a) Recall the example in Section 6.3 dealing with a thin infinite wire carrying current I. We showed that the vector potential A given in Eq. (6.34), or equivalently in Eq. (12.272) in the solution to Problem 6.4, correctly produced the desired magnetic field B. However, although they successfully produced B, there is something fundamentally wrong with those expressions for A. What is it? (The infinities at r = 0 and r = ∞ are technically fine.)

(b) As mentioned at the end of Section 6.3, if you use Eq. (6.44) to calculate A for an infinite wire, you will obtain an infinite result. Your task here is instead to calculate A for a finite wire of length 2L (ignore the return path for the current), at a distance r from the center. You can then find an approximate expression for A for large L (is the issue from part (a) fixed?), and then take the curl to obtain B, and then take the L → ∞ limit to obtain the B field for a truly infinite wire.
