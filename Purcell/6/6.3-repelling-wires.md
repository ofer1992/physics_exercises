## Problem Statement
Suppose that the current $I_2$ in Fig. 6.4(b) is equal to $I_1$, but reversed, so that CD is repelled by GH. Suppose also that AB and EF lie vertically above GH, that the lengths BC and CD are 30 and 15 cm, respectively, and that the conductor BCDE, which is 1 mm diameter copper wire as in Fig. 6.4(a), has a weight of 0.08 N/m. In equilibrium the deflection of the hanging frame from the vertical is such that r = 0.5 cm. How large is the current? Is the equilibrium stable?

## Solution 
1 mm Copper Wire:
$\lambda = 0.08 \frac{N}{cm}$
$d = 0.5$ cm

What is the magnetic field generated by GH? From Biot-Savart law:

$$\vec{B}(r) = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \int \frac{d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}}{r^2}$$

We derived for the infinite wire the formula:

$$|\vec{B}(d)| = \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi d} I$$

with the direction curling around the wire according to the RH rule.

Now the force the wire feels in the magnetic field is:

$$\vec{F} = I \int d\vec{l} \times \vec{B}$$

Since the wire has a fixed distance and is perpendicular to the field, the magnitude is:
$$|F| = I^2 L_{CD} \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi d}$$
where $L_{CD}$ is the length of segment CD.

Force diagram shows the equilibrium of forces F, T, and W.

Let's choose xy axis to align with F, T. Then:

$$\begin{align}
F + W_x &= 0 \\
T + W_y &= 0
\end{align}$$

T is just a normal force, so we're only interested in the first equation:

$$\begin{align}
I^2L_{CD} \frac{\mu_0}{2\pi d} - W \sin \theta &= 0 \\
\sin \theta &= \frac{d}{L_{BC}}
\end{align}$$

Solving for $I^2$:
$$\begin{align}
I^2 &= \frac{2\pi d}{\mu_0 L_{CD}} \lambda \cdot L_{CD} \cdot \frac{d}{L_{BC}} \\
&= \frac{2\pi \lambda}{\mu_0} \frac{d^2}{L_{BC}}
\end{align}$$

Substituting the numbers ($\mu_0 = 4\pi \cdot 10^{-7} \frac{kg\cdot m}{C^2}$):

$$\begin{align}
I^2 &= \frac{2\pi}{\mu_0} \cdot 0.08 \frac{N}{cm} \cdot \frac{(0.5 \times 10^{-2} \text{ cm})^2}{30 \times 10^{-2} \text{ cm}} \\
&= 0.5 \times 10^7 \frac{C^2}{kg\cdot m} \cdot \frac{8}{3} \times 10^{-3} \cdot 25 \times 10^{-4} \text{ N} \\
&= \frac{1}{3} \times 10^{-4} \text{ A}^2
\end{align}$$

Therefore: $$I = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \times 10^{-2} \text{ A}$$

The equilibrium is stable, since decreasing $\theta$ increases F while decreasing $W \sin \theta$, i.e., pushing CD away, and similarly when we increase $\theta$.

Note: After looking at the solution, I didn't take the weight of the vertical sections into account. I think you have to use torques here since I imagine the anchor point applies more than a radial force.
