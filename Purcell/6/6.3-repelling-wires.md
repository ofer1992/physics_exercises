## Problem Statement
Suppose that the current $$I_2$$ in Fig. 6.4(b) is equal to $$I_1$$, but reversed, so that CD is repelled by GH. Suppose also that AB and EF lie vertically above GH, that the lengths BC and CD are 30 and 15 cm, respectively, and that the conductor BCDE, which is 1 mm diameter copper wire as in Fig. 6.4(a), has a weight of 0.08 N/m. In equilibrium the deflection of the hanging frame from the vertical is such that r = 0.5 cm. How large is the current? Is the equilibrium stable?
