## Problem Statement
A ring with radius R carries a current I. Show that the magnetic field due to the ring, at a point in the plane of the ring, a distance a from the center (either inside or outside the ring), is given by

$$B = 2 \cdot \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int_0^\pi \frac{(R - a \cos \theta)R d\theta}{(a^2 + R^2 - 2aR \cos \theta)^{3/2}}$$

Hint: The easiest way to handle the cross product in the Biot–Savart law is to write the Cartesian coordinates of dl and r in terms of an angle θ in the ring.

This integral can't be evaluated in closed form (except in terms of elliptic functions), but it can always be evaluated numerically if desired. For the special case of a = 0 at the center of the ring, the integral is easy to do; verify that it yields the result given in Eq. (6.54).
