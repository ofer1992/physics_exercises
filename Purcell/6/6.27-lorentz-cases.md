## Problem Statement
Figure 6.39 shows four setups involving two infinite charged sheets in a given frame F. Another frame F' moves to the right with speed v. Explain why these setups demonstrate the six indicated special cases (depending on which field is set equal to zero) of the Lorentz transformations in Eq. (6.76):

$$E'_\parallel = E_\parallel$$ 
$$E'_\perp = \gamma(E_\perp + v \times B_\perp)$$ 
$$B'_\parallel = B_\parallel$$ 
$$B'_\perp = \gamma(B_\perp - (v/c^2) \times E_\perp)$$

(Note: one of the sheets has been drawn shorter to indicate length contraction. This is purely symbolic; all of the sheets have infinite length.)
