## Problem Statement
(a) Consider an infinite straight wire carrying current I. We know that the magnetic field outside the wire is $B = (\mu_0 I/2\pi r) \hat{\theta}$. There are no currents outside the wire, so $\nabla \times B = 0$; verify this by explicitly calculating the curl.

(b) Since $\nabla \times B = 0$, we should be able to write B as the gradient of a function, $B = \nabla \psi$. Find ψ, but then explain why the usefulness of ψ as a potential function is limited.

## Solution 

(a) We need to calculate $\nabla \times \mathbf{B} = \nabla \times (\mu_0 I/2\pi r)\hat{\theta}$

In cylindrical coordinates, for a vector field $\mathbf{A} = A_r\hat{r} + A_\theta\hat{\theta} + A_z\hat{z}$, the curl is:
$$\nabla \times \mathbf{A} = \left(\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial A_z}{\partial \theta} - \frac{\partial A_\theta}{\partial z}\right)\hat{r} + \left(\frac{\partial A_r}{\partial z} - \frac{\partial A_z}{\partial r}\right)\hat{\theta} + \frac{1}{r}\left(\frac{\partial (rA_\theta)}{\partial r} - \frac{\partial A_r}{\partial \theta}\right)\hat{z}$$

In our case, $A_r = 0$, $A_\theta = \mu_0 I/2\pi r$, $A_z = 0$, so:
$$\begin{align*}
\nabla \times \mathbf{B} &= -\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left(\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}\right)\hat{r} + 0\cdot\hat{\theta} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}\right)\hat{z} \\
&= 0\cdot\hat{r} + 0\cdot\hat{\theta} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi}\right)\hat{z} \\
&= 0
\end{align*}$$

(b) If the gradient is aligned with $\hat{\theta}$, it should be constant on radial lines.

$\nabla f = \frac{\partial f}{\partial r}\hat{r} + \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial f}{\partial \theta}\hat{\theta} + \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}\hat{z}$

So we see $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial r} = 0$, $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial z} = 0$ and

$\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi r}$

$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi} \implies \psi = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi}\theta$

The usefulness of the potential is limited since it can't help us calculate line integrals, since their value is not uniquely defined, seeing how the potential isn't uniquely defined anywhere or at the origin at all. It's easier to see if we look at it in Cartesian coordinates:

$\psi = \frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi}\arctan\frac{y}{x}$

Putting the math issues aside, physically we know that going round the wire adds up arbitrary multiples of $\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi}$ to the integral.
