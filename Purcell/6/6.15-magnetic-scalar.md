## Problem Statement
(a) Consider an infinite straight wire carrying current I. We know that the magnetic field outside the wire is $$B = (\mu_0 I/2\pi r) \hat{\theta}$$. There are no currents outside the wire, so $$\nabla \times B = 0$$; verify this by explicitly calculating the curl.

(b) Since $$\nabla \times B = 0$$, we should be able to write B as the gradient of a function, $$B = \nabla \psi$$. Find ψ, but then explain why the usefulness of ψ as a potential function is limited.
