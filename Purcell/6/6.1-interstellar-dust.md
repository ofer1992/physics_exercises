## Problem Statement
This problem concerns the electrically charged interstellar dust grain that was the subject of Exercise 2.38. Its mass, which was not involved in that problem, may be taken as $$10^{-16}$$ kg. Suppose it is moving quite freely, with speed $$v \ll c$$, in a plane perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field, which in that region has a strength of $$3 \cdot 10^{-6}$$ gauss. How many years will it take to complete a circular orbit?
