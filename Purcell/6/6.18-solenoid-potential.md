## Problem Statement
A solenoid has radius R, current I, and n turns per unit length. Given that the magnetic field is $$B = \mu_0 n I$$ inside and $$B = 0$$ outside, find the vector potential A both inside and outside. Do this in two ways as follows.

(a) Use the result from Exercise 6.41.

(b) Use the expression for the curl in cylindrical coordinates given in Appendix F to find the forms of A that yield the correct values of $$B = \nabla \times A$$ in the two regions.
