## Problem Statement
Consider the result from Problem 6.12. In the $$a \gg R$$ limit (that is, very far from the ring), make suitable approximations and show that the magnitude of the magnetic field in the plane of the ring is approximately equal to $$(\mu_0/4\pi)(m/a^3)$$, where $$m \equiv \pi R^2 I = (\text{area})I$$ is the magnetic dipole moment of the ring. This is a special case of a result we will derive in Chapter 11.
