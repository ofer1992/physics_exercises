## Problem Statement
A student said, "You almost convinced me that the force between currents, which I thought was magnetism, is explained by electric fields of moving charges. But if so, why doesn't the metal plate in Fig. 5.1(c) shield one wire from the influence of the other?" Can you explain it?
