## Problem Statement
A point charge q moves with speed v along the line y = r in the xy plane. We want to find the magnetic field at the origin at the moment the charge crosses the y axis.

(a) Starting with the electric field in the charge's frame, use the Lorentz transformation to show that, in the lab frame, the magnitude of the magnetic field at the origin (at the moment the charge crosses the y axis) equals $$B = (\mu_0/4\pi)(\gamma qv/r^2)$$.

(b) Use the Biot–Savart law to calculate the magnetic field at the origin. For the purposes of obtaining the current, you may assume that the "point" charge takes the shape of a very short stick. You should obtain an incorrect answer, lacking the γ factor in the above correct answer.

(c) The Biot–Savart method is invalid because the Biot–Savart law holds for steady currents (or slowly changing ones, but see Footnote 8). But the current due to the point charge is certainly not steady. At a given location along the line of the charge's motion, the current is zero, then nonzero, then zero again.

For non-steady currents, the validity of the Biot–Savart law can be restored if we use the so-called "retarded time." The basic idea with the retarded time is that, since information can travel no faster than the speed of light, the magnetic field at the origin, at the moment the charge crosses the y axis, must be related to what the charge was doing at an earlier time. More precisely, this earlier time (the "retarded time") is the time such that if a light signal were emitted from the charge at this time, then it would reach the origin at the same instant the charge crosses the y axis. Said in another way, if someone standing at the origin takes a photograph of the surroundings at the moment the charge crosses the y axis, then the position of the charge in the photograph (which will not be on the y axis) is the charge's location we are concerned with.

Your tasks are to: find the location of the charge in the photograph; explain why the length of the little stick representing the charge has a greater length in the photograph than you might naively think; find this length. For the purposes of calculating the vector potential A at the origin, we therefore see that the current extends over a greater length than in the incorrect calculation above in part (b). Show that this effect produces the necessary extra γ factor in A, and hence also in B. (Having taken into account the retarded time, the expression for A in Eq. (6.46) remains valid.)
