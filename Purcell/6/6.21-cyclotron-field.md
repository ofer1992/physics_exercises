## Problem Statement
For some purposes it is useful to accelerate negative hydrogen ions in a cyclotron. A negative hydrogen ion, H⁻, is a hydrogen atom to which an extra electron has become attached. The attachment is fairly weak; an electric field of only $$4.5 \cdot 10^8$$ V/m in the frame of the ion (a rather small field by atomic standards) will pull an electron loose, leaving a hydrogen atom. If we want to accelerate H⁻ ions up to a kinetic energy of 1 GeV ($$10^9$$ eV), what is the highest magnetic field we dare use to keep them on a circular orbit up to final energy? (To find γ for this problem you only need the rest energy of the H⁻ ion, which is of course practically the same as that of the proton, approximately 1 GeV.)
