## Problem Statement
A volume current density $$J = J\hat{z}$$ exists in a slab between the infinite planes at x = âˆ’b and x = b. (So the current is coming out of the page in Fig. 6.37.) Additionally, a surface current density $$J = 2bJ$$ points in the $$-\hat{z}$$ direction on the plane at x = b.

(a) Find the magnetic field as a function of x, both inside and outside the slab.

(b) Verify that $$\nabla \times B = \mu_0 J$$ inside the slab. (Don't worry about the boundaries.)
