## Problem Statement
Consider an infinite solenoid with circular cross section. The current is I, and there are n turns per unit length. Show that the magnetic field is zero outside and $$B = \mu_0 n I$$ (in the longitudinal direction) everywhere inside. Do this in three steps as follows.

(a) Show that the field has only a longitudinal component. Hint: Consider the contributions to the field from rings that are symmetrically located with respect to a given point.

(b) Use Amp√®re's law to show that the field has a uniform value outside and a uniform value inside, and that these two values differ by $$\mu_0 n I$$.

(c) Show that $$B \rightarrow 0$$ as $$r \rightarrow \infty$$. There are various ways to do this. One is to obtain an upper bound on the field contribution due to a given ring by unwrapping the ring into a straight wire segment, and then finding the field due to this straight segment.
