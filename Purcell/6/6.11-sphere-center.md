## Solution 
σ - surface charge density
ω - angular frequency

$$\text{curl }\vec{B} = \mu_0\vec{J}$$

$\vec{J}$ only depends on $\rho$. $\rho$ affects both the speed and the differential area. It should be in units of $\frac{A}{m^2}$.

From dimensionality I would guess $\vec{J} = \sigma R\sin\rho\omega\hat{\theta}$.

The only caveat I have is that it's usually done with volume charge density.

Another way to look at it is to divide the sphere into circles. For a circle at angle $\rho$, the amount of charge is $2\pi R\sin\rho d\sigma$. Looking at one point, during a whole revolution that amount of charge passes that point, so the current is:

$$dI = \frac{2\pi R\sin\rho d\sigma}{2\pi/\omega} = R\sin\rho\sigma\omega d\rho$$

What's the field from a ring? I've done it before... field points up because of radial symmetry so we only care for vertical contributions.

$$
dB = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\int_0^{2\pi}\frac{(d\vec{l}\times\hat{r})\cdot\hat{z}}{r^3} = \frac{\mu_0 dI}{4\pi}\int\frac{bd\theta\cdot b}{(b^2+z^2)^{3/2}} = \frac{\mu_0dI}{2R}\sin^2\rho \\
$$
Let's use that to find the magnetic field from the whole sphere

$$
\begin{align}
B &= \int dB = \int\frac{\mu_0dI}{2R}\sin\rho \\
&= \frac{\mu_0}{2R}\int_0^\pi R^2\sin\rho\sigma\omega d\rho\sin\rho \\
&= \frac{\mu_0\sigma\omega R}{2}\int_0^\pi\sin^3\rho d\rho \\
&= \frac{\mu_0\sigma\omega R}{2}[\frac{3\cos\pi-\cos\rho}{3}]_0^\pi \\
&= \frac{\mu_0\sigma\omega R}{2}[-\frac{1}{3}+1-(\frac{1}{3}-1)] \\
&= \frac{\mu_0\sigma\omega R}{2}\cdot\frac{4}{3} = \frac{2}{3}\mu_0\sigma\omega R
\end{align}
