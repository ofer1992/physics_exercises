## Problem Statement
A solenoid is made by winding two layers of No. 14 copper wire on a cylindrical form 8 cm in diameter. There are four turns per centimeter in each layer, and the length of the solenoid is 32 cm. From the wire tables we find that No. 14 copper wire, which has a diameter of 0.163 cm, has a resistance of 0.010 ohm/m at 75Â°C. (The coil will run hot!) If the solenoid is connected to a 50 V generator, what will be the magnetic field strength at the center of the solenoid in gauss, and what is the power dissipation in watts?
