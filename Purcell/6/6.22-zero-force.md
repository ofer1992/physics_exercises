## Problem Statement
A neutral wire carries current I. A stationary charge is nearby. There is no electric field from the neutral wire, so the electric force on the charge is zero. And although there is a magnetic field, the charge isn't moving, so the magnetic force is also zero. The total force on the charge is therefore zero. Hence it must be zero in every other frame. Verify this, in a particular case, by using the Lorentz transformations to find the E and B fields in a frame moving parallel to the wire with velocity v.
