## Problem Statement
Consider a square loop with current I and side length a. The goal of this problem is to determine the magnetic field at a point a large distance r (with $$r \gg a$$) from the loop.

(a) At the distant point P in Fig. 6.36, the two vertical sides give essentially zero Biot–Savart contributions to the field, because they are essentially parallel to the radius vector to P. What are the Biot–Savart contributions from the two horizontal sides? These are easy to calculate because every little interval in these sides is essentially perpendicular to the radius vector to P. Show that the sum (or difference) of these contributions equals $$\mu_0 I a^2/2\pi r^3$$, to leading order in a.

(b) This result of $$\mu_0 I a^2/2\pi r^3$$ is not the correct field from the loop at point P. The correct field is half of this, or $$\mu_0 I a^2/4\pi r^3$$. We will eventually derive this in Chapter 11, where we will show that the general result is $$\mu_0 I A/4\pi r^3$$, where A is the area of a loop with arbitrary shape. But we should be able to calculate it via the Biot–Savart law. Where is the error in the reasoning in part (a), and how do you go about fixing it? This is a nice one – don't peek at the answer too soon!
