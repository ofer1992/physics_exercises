## Problem Statement
Consider a square loop with current I and side length a. The goal of this problem is to determine the magnetic field at a point a large distance r (with $r \gg a$) from the loop.

(a) At the distant point P in Fig. 6.36, the two vertical sides give essentially zero Biot–Savart contributions to the field, because they are essentially parallel to the radius vector to P. What are the Biot–Savart contributions from the two horizontal sides? These are easy to calculate because every little interval in these sides is essentially perpendicular to the radius vector to P. Show that the sum (or difference) of these contributions equals $\mu_0 I a^2/2\pi r^3$, to leading order in a.

(b) This result of $\mu_0 I a^2/2\pi r^3$ is not the correct field from the loop at point P. The correct field is half of this, or $\mu_0 I a^2/4\pi r^3$. We will eventually derive this in Chapter 11, where we will show that the general result is $\mu_0 I A/4\pi r^3$, where A is the area of a loop with arbitrary shape. But we should be able to calculate it via the Biot–Savart law. Where is the error in the reasoning in part (a), and how do you go about fixing it? This is a nice one – don't peek at the answer too soon!

## Solution 
The Biot-Savart law states:

$$d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} I \frac{d\vec{l} \times \hat{n}}{n^2}$$

### Draft Attempt

We assume $\vec{n}$ parallel to vertical sections and $\perp$ to horizontal.

Better to take a polar coordinate:

$\tan d = \frac{x}{r-a}$

$\tan \theta = \frac{x}{a}$

$\tan d = \frac{a\tan\theta}{r-a}$

$\sin \frac{\pi}{2} - d = \cos d$

$\cos d = \sin d/\tan d$

$d\vec{l} \times \hat{n} = dl\cos d$

Maybe integrate on $\alpha$...

$x = (r-a)\tan d$

$dx = \frac{r-a}{\cos^2 d} dd$

$n = (r-a)/\cos d$

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{dx\cos d}{n^2} &= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{(r-a)\cos d}{(r-a)^2/\cos^2 d} dd \\
&= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{\cos^3 d}{(r-a)} dd
\end{align*}$$

$$= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi(r-a)} [\sin \alpha]_{-\arctan \frac{a}{r-a}}^{\arctan \frac{a}{r-a}}$$

$$= \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi(r-a)} \cdot 2\sin \arctan\frac{a}{\sqrt{a^2+(r-a)^2}}$$

### Final Solution

Let's assume constant stuff for a sec, so:

Upper:
$$\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int \frac{d\vec{l} \times \hat{n}}{n^2} = \frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \frac{2a}{(r-a)^2}$$

Lower:
$$\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \frac{2a}{(r+a)^2}$$

The difference is then:

$$\frac{\mu_0 I}{2\pi} a\left[\frac{1}{(r-a)^2} - \frac{1}{(r+a)^2}\right] = \frac{\mu_0 I 4a^2}{2\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{r^3+a(...)}$$

Since we used $a$ as half a side this agrees with the formula in the question (note that this gives $4a^2$ since $a$ is half the side length).

(b) The vertical sections should both contribute to decrease the field, let's see by how much:

![[SmartSelect_20250109_160955_Samsung Notes.jpg]]

$n \simeq r-a+x$

$d\vec{l} \times \hat{n} = dl \cdot a$

$$\frac{\mu_0 I}{4\pi} \int_0^{2a} \frac{dl \cdot a}{(r-a+x)^3} = \frac{\mu_0 a}{4\pi} \left[-\frac{1}{2(r-a+x)^2}\right]_0^{2a}$$

$$= \frac{\mu_0 a}{4\pi} \cdot \frac{-1}{2}\left[\frac{1}{(r+a)^2} - \frac{1}{(r-a)^2}\right]$$

$$= \frac{\mu_0 a}{8\pi} \frac{4ar}{(r+a)^2(r-a)^2} = \frac{1}{4}\frac{\mu_0I4a^2}{2\pi} \cdot \frac{1}{r^3+a(...)}$$

So we see it's exactly a quarter of the quantity in (a). Since both vertical sides contribute the same amount and in the same direction, this decreases the total magnitude by half as supposed to be.
