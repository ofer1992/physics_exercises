## Problem Statement
(a) Use the Lorentz transformations to show that the E and B fields due to a point charge moving with constant velocity v are related by $$B = (v/c^2) \times E$$.

(b) If $$v \ll c$$, then E is essentially obtained from Coulomb's law, and B can be calculated from the Biot–Savart law. Calculate B this way, and then verify that it satisfies $$B = (v/c^2) \times E$$. (It may be helpful to think of the point charge as a tiny rod of charge, in order to get a handle on the dl in the Biot–Savart law.)
