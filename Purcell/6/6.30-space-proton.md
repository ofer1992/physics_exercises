## Problem Statement
A proton with kinetic energy $$10^{16}$$ eV ($$\gamma = 10^7$$) is moving perpendicular to the interstellar magnetic field, which in that region of the galaxy has a strength $$3 \cdot 10^{-6}$$ gauss. What is the radius of curvature of its path and how long does it take to complete one revolution? (Use the results from Exercise 6.29.)
