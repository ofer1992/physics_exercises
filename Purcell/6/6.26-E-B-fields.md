## Problem Statement
The task of Exercise 6.29 is to show that if a charged particle moves in the xy plane in the presence of a uniform magnetic field in the z direction, the path will be a circle. What does the path look like if we add on a uniform electric field in the y direction? Let the particle have mass m and charge q. And let the magnitudes of the electric and magnetic fields be E and B. Assume that the velocity is nonrelativistic, so that $$\gamma \approx 1$$ (this assumption isn't necessary in Exercise 6.29, because v is constant there). Be careful, the answer is a bit counterintuitive.
