## Problem Statement
(a) Two charges q are each located a distance d from a charge Q, as shown in Fig. 1.32(a). What should the charge Q be so that the system is in equilibrium; that is, so that the force on each charge is zero? (The equilibrium is an unstable one, which can be seen by looking at longitudinal displacements of the (negative) charge Q. This is consistent with a general result that we will derive Section 2.12.)

(b) Same question, but now with the setup in Fig. 1.32(b). The three charges q are located at the vertices of an equilateral triangle.

(c) Show that the total potential energy in each of the above systems is zero.

(d) In view of the previous result, we might make the following conjecture: "The total potential energy of any system of charges in equilibrium is zero." Prove that this conjecture is indeed true. Hint: The goal is to show that zero work is required to move the charges out to infinity. Since the electrostatic force is conservative, you need only show that the work is zero for one particular set of paths of the charges. And there is indeed a particular set of paths that makes the result clear.
