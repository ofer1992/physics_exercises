## Problem Statement
Figure 1.52 shows a spherical shell of charge, of radius $a$ and surface density $\sigma$, from which a small circular piece of radius $b \ll a$ has been removed. What is the direction and magnitude of the field at the midpoint of the aperture? There are two ways to get the answer. You can integrate over the remaining charge distribution to sum the contributions of all elements to the field at the point in question. Or, remembering the superposition principle, you can think about the effect of replacing the piece removed, which itself is practically a little disk. Note the connection of this result with our discussion of the force on a surface charge â€“ perhaps that is a third way in which you might arrive at the answer.

## Solution

### working notes
Sphere of radius $a$ and surface density $\sigma$. Outside the sphere the field is as if the entire charge is concentrated in the center:

$$E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{Q}{r^2}, \quad Q = 4\pi a^2\sigma$$

How do we know that? We can use Gauss and radial symmetry to get:

$$E \cdot 4\pi r^2 = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}Q$$

which after moving stuff around is just as above. Similarly when $r<a$ then $E=0$ since no charge is enclosed.

So we have a discontinuity.

Question: is this a conductor scenario, where charges are in equilibrium? For radial symmetry $\sigma$ must be constant on the sphere. This is equilibrium, again from radial symmetry, the field nowhere has a tangential component to the surface.

What is the radius in guessing the bow? Length $a \sin \frac{1}{2}\rho$

When $\rho \ll 1$ then $b \approx \rho a$

$$b = \rho a \rightarrow \rho = \frac{b}{a}$$

$$E = \int_0^{\rho} \int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\sin \rho \sin\frac{\rho}{2}}{\left(4\pi\epsilon_0(2a\sin\frac{\rho}{2})^2\right)^2} a^2d\theta d\rho$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} 2\pi \int_0^{\rho} \frac{a^2\sin \rho \sin\frac{\rho}{2}}{4a^2 \sin^2\frac{\rho}{2}} d\rho$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \int_0^{\rho} \frac{\rho \cdot \frac{1}{2}\rho}{4 \cdot \frac{1}{4}\rho^2} d\rho = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \cdot \rho = \frac{\sigma}{4\epsilon_0} \cdot \frac{b}{a}$$

The field from the whole sphere is:

$$\frac{1}{\epsilon_0} Q/4\pi a^2 = \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}$$

Hence the field without the cap is $\frac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}(1-\frac{b}{4a})$

We can also try without the approx:

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \int_0^{\rho} \frac{\sin \rho}{4\sin\frac{1}{2}\rho} d\rho$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \int_0^{\rho} \frac{1}{2} \cos\frac{1}{2}\rho d\rho$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \left[\sin\frac{1}{2}\rho\right]_0^{\rho} = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \sin\frac{1}{2}\rho$$
At This point I'm getting confused.
### Direct integration

Let's do it directly. Assume the aperture is located at the top part around the z axis. Then from radial symmetry the horizontal field cancels out and the vertical field is what remains. Using spherical coords:

$$E_z = \iint_{\rho_0}^{\pi} \frac{\sigma}{4\pi\epsilon_0 r^2} \cdot \sin\frac{1}{2}\rho \cdot a^2 \sin\rho d\theta d\rho$$

where $r = 2a\sin\frac{1}{2}\rho$

$$E_z = \frac{\sigma}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \cdot 2\pi \int_{\rho_0}^{\pi} \frac{2\sin^3\frac{1}{2}\rho \cos\frac{1}{2}\rho}{4\sin^2\frac{1}{2}\rho} d\rho$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \int_{\rho_0}^{\pi} \frac{1}{2}\cos\frac{1}{2}\rho d\rho$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\left[\sin\frac{1}{2}\rho\right]_{\rho_0}^{\pi}$$

$$E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\left[1-\sin\frac{1}{2}\rho_0\right]$$

assuming $b \ll a$ then $\rho_0 \approx \frac{b}{a} \approx 0$ and we get that $E = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}$.

## Notes
A strange result. Do [[1.30-patch-force]], it's related.
