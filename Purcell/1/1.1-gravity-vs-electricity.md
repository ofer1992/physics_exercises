## Problem Statement
(a) In the domain of elementary particles, a natural unit of mass is the mass of a nucleon, that is, a proton or a neutron, the basic massive building blocks of ordinary matter. Given the nucleon mass as $1.67 \cdot 10^{-27}$ kg and the gravitational constant G as $6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}$ $\text{m}^3/(\text{kg s}^2)$, compare the gravitational attraction of two protons with their electrostatic repulsion. This shows why we call gravitation a very weak force.

(b) The distance between the two protons in the helium nucleus could be at one instant as much as $10^{-15}$ m. How large is the force of electrical repulsion between two protons at that distance? Express it in newtons, and in pounds. Even stronger is the nuclear force that acts between any pair of hadrons (including neutrons and protons) when they are that close together.

## Solution 

(a) mass of nucleon = $1.67 \cdot 10^{-27}$ kg , $G = 6.67 \cdot 10^{-11}$ $m^3/(kg\,s^2)$

gravitational attraction $F_G = G \frac{m_1m_2}{r^2}$

In our case $6\frac{2}{3} \cdot 2\frac{7}{9} \cdot 10^{-65}/r^2=$

How about electrostatic repulsion?

$F_e = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q_1q_2}{r^2}$

charge of proton is $e = 1.602\cdot10^{-19}$ C

$\epsilon_0 = 8.854\cdot10^{-12}$ $\frac{C^2}{Nm^2}$

Or we can just use $k \approx 9\cdot10^9$ $\frac{Nm^2}{C^2}$

Then $F_e = 9\cdot(1.602)^2\cdot10^{-29}/r^2$

So the Coulomb force is about $10^{36}$ times stronger

b) $r = 10^{-15}$ m

$F_e = 9\cdot(1.602)^2\cdot10^{-29}/(10^{-15})^2\approx 230$ N

In pounds ITS x0.22 which is approx 45 lbf
