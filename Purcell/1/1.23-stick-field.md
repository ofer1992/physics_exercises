## Problem Statement
A stick with length 2â„“ has uniform linear charge density $\lambda$. Consider a point P, a distance $\eta$ from the center (where $0 \leq \eta < \ell$), and an infinitesimal distance away from the stick. Up close, the stick looks infinitely long, as far as the $E_\perp$ component perpendicular to the stick is concerned. So we have $E_\perp = \lambda/2\pi\epsilon_0r$. Find the E component parallel to the stick, $E_\parallel$. Does it approach infinity, or does it remain finite at the end of the stick?
