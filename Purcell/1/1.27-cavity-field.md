## Problem Statement
A sphere has radius $R_1$ and uniform volume charge density $\rho$. A spherical cavity with radius $R_2$ is carved out at an arbitrary location inside the larger sphere. Show that the electric field inside the cavity is uniform (in both magnitude and direction). Hint: Find a vector expression for the field in the interior of a charged sphere, and then use superposition.

What are the analogous statements for the lower-dimensional analogs with cylinders and slabs? Are the statements still true?
