## Problem Statement
A charge 2q is at the origin, and a charge −q is at x = a on the x axis.

(a) Find the point on the x axis where the electric field is zero.

(b) Consider the vertical line passing through the charge −q, that is, the line given by x = a. Locate, at least approximately, a point on this line where the electric field is parallel to the x axis.

## Solution

(a) There are two regions where the fields from the particles oppose each other: $x < 0$ and $x > a$ (we assume $a > 0$, other case would be symmetrical)

At $x < 0$ the field from the $2q$ charge always overpowers the field from $-q$ charge, so that leaves $x > a$

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{2q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 x^2} &= \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(x-a)^2} \\
2(x-a)^2 &= x^2 \\
2x^2 - 4xa + 2a^2 &= x^2 \\
x^2 - 4xa + 2a^2 &= 0 \\
x_{1,2} &= \frac{4a \pm \sqrt{16a^2-8a^2}}{2} = \frac{4a \pm 2\sqrt{2}a}{2} = (2 \pm \sqrt{2})a
\end{align*}$$

We then rule out $(2-\sqrt{2})a < a$ as a solution and are left with $x = (2+\sqrt{2})a$

(b) Consider the angle $\theta$ from the x axis.

- Distance from origin = $a/\cos\theta$
- Vertical field = $E\sin\theta$
- Vertical distance to $x=a$ = $a\tan\theta$

We're looking for an angle $\theta$ s.t.

$$\begin{align*}
\frac{2q}{4\pi\epsilon_0(\frac{a}{\cos\theta})^2}\sin\theta &= \frac{q}{4\pi\epsilon_0 a^2\tan^2\theta} \\
2\cos^2\theta\sin\theta\tan^2\theta &= 1 \\
\sin^3\theta &= \frac{1}{2} \\
\theta &= \sin^{-1}(2^{-1/3})
\end{align*}$$

To get an answer in terms of a y value, $y = a\tan\theta$
$$\begin{align*}
&= a\frac{\sin\theta}{\sqrt{1-\sin^2\theta}} \\
&= a\sqrt{\frac{2^{-2/3}}{1-2^{-2/3}}} \\
&= a/\sqrt{2^{2/3}-1}
\end{align*}$$

Also $-a/\sqrt{2^{2/3}-1}$ works in this case from symmetry.
