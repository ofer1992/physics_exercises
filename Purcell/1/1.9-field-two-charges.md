## Problem Statement
A charge 2q is at the origin, and a charge −q is at x = a on the x axis.

(a) Find the point on the x axis where the electric field is zero.

(b) Consider the vertical line passing through the charge −q, that is, the line given by x = a. Locate, at least approximately, a point on this line where the electric field is parallel to the x axis.
