## Problem Statement
The result of Exercise 1.78 [[1.78-hole-in-shell]] is that the electric field at the center of a small hole in a spherical shell equals $\sigma/2\epsilon_0$. This happens to be the same as the field due to an infinite flat sheet with the same density $\sigma$. That is, at the center of the hole at the top of the spherical shell in the figure, the field from the shell equals the field from the infinite horizontal sheet shown. (This sheet could actually be located at any height.) Demonstrate this equality by explaining why the rings on the shell and sheet that are associated with the angle $\theta$ and angular width $d\theta$ yield the same field at the top of the shell.
