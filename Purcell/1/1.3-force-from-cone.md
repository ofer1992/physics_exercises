## Problem Statement
(a) A charge q is located at the tip of a hollow cone (such as an ice cream cone without the ice cream) with surface charge density $$\sigma$$. The slant height of the cone is L, and the half-angle at the vertex is $$\theta$$. What can you say about the force on the charge q due to the cone?

(b) If the top half of the cone is removed and thrown away (see below), what is the force on the charge q due to the remaining part of the cone? For what angle $$\theta$$ is this force maximum?
