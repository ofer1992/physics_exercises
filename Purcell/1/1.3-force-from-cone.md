## Problem Statement
(a) A charge q is located at the tip of a hollow cone (such as an ice cream cone without the ice cream) with surface charge density $\sigma$. The slant height of the cone is L, and the half-angle at the vertex is $\theta$. What can you say about the force on the charge q due to the cone?

(b) If the top half of the cone is removed and thrown away (see below), what is the force on the charge q due to the remaining part of the cone? For what angle $\theta$ is this force maximum?

## Solution: Electric Force on Charge Near Charged Cone

(a) From symmetry we know it will point up.
We only care about the vertical component of the force.

$$F = F\cos\theta = \frac{q\sigma}{r^2}dA$$

$$dA = r\sin\theta\,dr\,d\phi$$

$$\iint F\cos\theta\, r\sin\theta\,dr\,d\phi$$

$$= 2\pi \int_{r=0}^L \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\frac{q\sigma}{r^2}\cos\theta\,r\sin\theta\,dr$$

$$= \frac{q\sigma\cos\theta\sin\theta}{2\epsilon_0}\int_0^L \frac{1}{r}dr$$

$$\left[\log r\right]_0^L = \text{Infinite!}$$

(b) It will be:

$$\frac{q\sigma\cos\theta\sin\theta}{2\epsilon_0}[\log L - \log L/2]$$

$$= \frac{q\sigma\cos\theta\sin\theta}{2\epsilon_0}\log 2$$

$$\cos\theta\sin\theta = \frac{1}{2}\sin 2\theta \Rightarrow \text{maxed at}\ 2\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$$

$$\theta = \frac{\pi}{4}$$
