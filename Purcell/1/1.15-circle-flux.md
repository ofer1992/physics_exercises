## Problem Statement
A point charge q is located at the origin. Consider the electric field flux through a circle a distance $\ell$ from q, subtending an angle $2\theta$. Since there are no charges except at the origin, any surface that is bounded by the circle and that stays to the right of the origin must contain the same flux. (Why?) Calculate this flux by taking the surface to be:

(a) the flat disk bounded by the circle;

(b) the spherical cap (with the sphere centered at the origin) bounded by the circle.
