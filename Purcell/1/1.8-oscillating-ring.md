## Problem Statement
A ring with radius R has uniform positive charge density $\lambda$. A particle with positive charge q and mass m is initially located at the center of the ring and is then given a tiny kick. If it is constrained to move in the plane of the ring, show that it undergoes simple harmonic motion (for small oscillations), and find the frequency. Hint: Find the potential energy of the particle when it is at a (small) radius, r, by integrating over the ring, and then take the negative derivative to find the force. You will need to use the law of cosines and also the Taylor series $1/\sqrt{1 + \epsilon} \approx 1 - \epsilon/2 + 3\epsilon^2/8$.
