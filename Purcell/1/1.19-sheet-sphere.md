## Problem Statement
Consider a large flat horizontal sheet with thickness x and volume charge density $\rho$. This sheet is tangent to a sphere with radius R and volume charge density $\rho_0$. Let A be the point of tangency, and let B be the point opposite to A on the top side of the sheet. Show that the net upward electric field (from the sphere plus the sheet) at B is larger than at A if $\rho > (2/3)\rho_0$. (Assume x â‰ª R.)
