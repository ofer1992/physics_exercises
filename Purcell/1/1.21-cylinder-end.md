## Problem Statement
Consider a half-infinite hollow cylindrical shell (that is, one that extends to infinity in one direction) with uniform surface charge density. Show that at all points in the circular end face, the electric field is parallel to the cylinder's axis. Hint: Use superposition, along with what you know about the field from an infinite (in both directions) hollow cylinder.
