## Problem Statement
(a) Two rings with radius r have charge Q and âˆ’Q uniformly distributed around them. The rings are parallel and located a distance h apart, as shown in the figure. Let z be the vertical coordinate, with z = 0 taken to be at the center of the lower ring. As a function of z, what is the electric field at points on the axis of the rings?

(b) You should find that the electric field is an even function with respect to the z = h/2 point midway between the rings. This implies that, at this point, the field has a local extremum as a function of z. The field is therefore fairly uniform there; there are no variations to first order in the distance along the axis from the midpoint. What should r be in terms of h so that the field is very uniform?

By "very" uniform we mean that additionally there aren't any variations to second order in z. That is, the second derivative vanishes. This then implies that the leading-order change is fourth order in z (because there are no variations at any odd order, since the field is an even function around the midpoint). Feel free to calculate the derivatives with a computer.
