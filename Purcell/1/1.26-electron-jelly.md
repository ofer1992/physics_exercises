## Problem Statement
The task of Exercise 1.77 is to find the equilibrium positions of two protons located inside a sphere of electron jelly with total charge -2e. Show that the equilibria are stable. That is, show that a displacement in any direction will result in a force directed back toward the equilibrium position. (There is no need to know the exact locations of the equilibria, so you can solve this problem without solving Exercise 1.77 first.)
