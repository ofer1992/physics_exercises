## Problem Statement
The electric field outside and an infinitesimal distance away from a uniformly charged spherical shell, with radius R and surface charge density $\sigma$, is given by Eq. (1.42) as $\sigma/\epsilon_0$. Derive this in the following way.

(a) Slice the shell into rings (symmetrically located with respect to the point in question), and then integrate the field contributions from all the rings. You should obtain the incorrect result of $\sigma/2\epsilon_0$.

(b) Why isn't the result correct? Explain how to modify it to obtain the correct result of $\sigma/\epsilon_0$. Hint: You could very well have performed the above integral in an effort to obtain the electric field an infinitesimal distance inside the shell, where we know the field is zero. Does the above integration provide a good description of what's going on for points on the shell that are very close to the point in question?
