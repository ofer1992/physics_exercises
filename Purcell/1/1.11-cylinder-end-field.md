## Problem Statement
(a) Consider a half-infinite hollow cylindrical shell (that is, one that extends to infinity in one direction) with radius R and uniform surface charge density $\sigma$. What is the electric field at the midpoint of the end face?

(b) Use your result to determine the field at the midpoint of a half-infinite solid cylinder with radius R and uniform volume charge density $\rho$, which can be considered to be built up from many cylindrical shells.
