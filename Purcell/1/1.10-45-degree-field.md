## Problem Statement
A half-infinite line has linear charge density $\lambda$. Find the electric field at a point that is "even" with the end, a distance $\ell$ from it, as shown in the figure. You should find that the field always points up at a 45Â° angle, independent of $\ell$.

## Solution 

I wonder if a symmetry argument still works when the transformation is magnification.
