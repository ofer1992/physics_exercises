## Problem Statement
In the setup in Exercise 1.37, is the charge $-Q$ at the center of the square in stable or unstable equilibrium? You can answer this by working with either forces or energies. The latter has the advantage of not involving components, although things can still get quite messy. However, the math is simple if you use a computer. Imagine moving the $-Q$ charge infinitesimally to the point $(x, y)$, and use, for example, the Series operation in Mathematica to calculate the new energy of the charge, to lowest nontrivial order in x and y. If the energy decreases for at least one direction of displacement, then the equilibrium is unstable. (The equilibrium is certainly stable with respect to displacements perpendicular to the plane of the square, because the attractive force from the other charges is directed back toward the plane. The question is, what happens in the plane of the square?)
