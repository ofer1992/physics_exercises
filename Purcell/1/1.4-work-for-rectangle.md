## Problem Statement
Two protons and two electrons are located at the corners of a rectangle with side lengths a and b. There are two essentially different arrangements. Consider the work required to assemble the system, starting with the particles very far apart. Is it possible for the work to be positive for either of the arrangements? If so, how must a and b be related? You will need to solve something numerically.
