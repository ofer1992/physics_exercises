## Problem Statement
(a) Two point charges q are located at positions x = ±ℓ. At points close to the origin on the x axis, find $E_x$. At points close to the origin on the y axis, find $E_y$. Make suitable approximations with x ≪ ℓ and y ≪ ℓ.

(b) Consider a small cylinder centered at the origin, with its axis along the x axis. The radius is $r_0$ and the length is $2x_0$. Using your results from part (a), verify that there is zero flux through the cylinder, as required by Gauss's law.
