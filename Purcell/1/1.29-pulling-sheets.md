## Problem Statement
Two parallel sheets each have large area A and are separated by a small distance ℓ. The surface charge densities are $\sigma$ and $-\sigma$. You wish to pull one of the sheets away from the other, by a small distance x. How much work does this require? Calculate this by:

(a) using the relation W = (force) × (distance);
(b) calculating the increase in energy stored in the electric field.

Show that these two methods give the same result.
