## Problem Statement
Consider a small patch of charge that is part of a larger surface. The surface charge density is $\sigma$. If $E_1$ and $E_2$ are the electric fields on either side of the patch, show that the force per unit area on the patch equals $\sigma(E_1 + E_2)/2$. This is the result we derived in Section 1.14, for the case where the field is perpendicular to the surface. Derive it here by using the fact that the force on the patch is due to the field $E_{other}$ from all the other charges in the system (excluding the patch), and then finding an expression for $E_{other}$ in terms of $E_1$ and $E_2$.
