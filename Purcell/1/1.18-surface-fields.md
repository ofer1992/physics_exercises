## Problem Statement
Consider the electric field at a point on the surface of:
(a) a sphere with radius R,
(b) a cylinder with radius R whose length is infinite, and 
(c) a slab with thickness 2R whose other two dimensions are infinite.

All of the objects have the same volume charge density $\rho$. Compare the fields in the three cases, and explain physically why the sizes take the order they do.
