## Problem Statement
Consider a hollow spherical shell with uniform surface charge density. By considering the two small patches at the ends of the thin cones in the figure, show that the electric field at any point P in the interior of the shell is zero. This then implies that the electric potential (defined in Chapter 2) is constant throughout the interior.
