## Problem Statement
(a) The result given in Exercise 4.32 below is only an approximate one, valid in the limit where the taper is slow (that is, where a − b is much smaller than the length of the cone). It can't be universally valid, because in the b → ∞ limit the resistance of the cone would be zero. But the object shown in Fig. 4.31 certainly doesn't have a resistance that approaches zero as b → ∞. Why isn't the result valid?

(b) The technique given in the hint in Exercise 4.32 is valid for the object shown in Fig. 4.32, which has spherical endcaps (with a common center) as its end faces. The radial distance between the faces is l and their areas are $A_1$ and $A_2$. Find the resistance between the end faces.
