## Problem Statement
N points in space are connected by a collection of resistors, all with the same value R. The network of resistors is arbitrary (and not necessarily planar), except for the one restriction that it is "connected" (that is, it is possible to travel between any two points via an unbroken chain of resistors). Two given points may be connected by multiple resistors (see Fig. 4.34), so the number of resistors emanating from a given point can be any number greater than or equal to 1.

Consider a particular resistor. The network produces an effective resistance between the two points at the ends of this resistor. What is the sum of the effective resistances across all the resistors in the network? (The result is known as Foster's theorem.) Solve this in two steps as follows.

(a) Find the desired sum for the various networks shown in Fig. 4.34. For example, in the first network, two of the effective resistances (in units of R) are 2/5 (from a 2 and a 1/2 in parallel) and two are 3/5 (from a 1 and a 3/2 in parallel), so the sum of all four effective resistances is 2. Remember that the sum is over all resistors and not pairs of points, so the two curved resistors each get counted once.

(b) Based on your results in part (a), and perhaps with the help of some other networks you can randomly make up, you should be able to make a conjecture about the general case with N points and an arbitrary configuration of equal resistors (subject to the condition that the network is connected). Prove your conjecture. Note: The solution is extremely tricky, so you may want to look at the hint given in the first paragraph of the solution. Even with this hint it is still very tricky.
