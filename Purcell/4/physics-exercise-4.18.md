## Problem Statement
(a) The circuit in Fig. 4.43 contains two identical capacitors and two identical resistors. Initially, the left capacitor has charge $Q_0$ (with the left plate positive), and the right capacitor is uncharged. If the switch is closed at t = 0, find the charges on the capacitors as functions of time. Your loop equations should be simple ones.

(b) Answer the same question for the circuit in Fig. 4.44, in which we have added one more (identical) resistor. What is the maximum (or minimum) charge that the right capacitor achieves? Note: Your loop equations should now be more interesting. Perhaps the easiest way to solve them is to take their sum and difference. This allows you to solve for the sum and difference of the charges, from which you can obtain each charge individually.
