## Problem Statement
Find the Thévenin equivalent resistance $R_{eq}$ for the circuit in Fig. 4.24(a). Do this by calculating the short-circuit current $I_{sc}$ between A and B, and then using $R_{eq} = E_{eq}/I_{sc}$. (You can use the fact that $E_{eq} = I_3R_3$, where $I_3$ is given in Eq. (4.33).)
