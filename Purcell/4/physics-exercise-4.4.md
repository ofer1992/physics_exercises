## Problem Statement
(a) The region between two concentric spherical shells is filled with a material with resistivity ρ. The inner radius is $r_1$, and the outer radius $r_2$ is many times larger (essentially infinite). Show that the resistance between the shells is essentially equal to $\rho/4\pi r_1$.

(b) Without doing any calculations, dimensional analysis suggests that the above resistance should be proportional to $\rho/r_1$, because ρ has units of ohm-meters and $r_1$ has units of meters. But is this reasoning rigorous?
