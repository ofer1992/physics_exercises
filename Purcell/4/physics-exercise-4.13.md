## Problem Statement
Consider an arbitrary circuit A and an additional arbitrary circuit B connected to A's external leads, as shown in Fig. 4.38. Prove Thévenin's theorem. That is, show that, as far as B is concerned, A acts the same as a single emf $E_{eq}$ connected in series with a single resistor $R_{eq}$; explain how to determine these two quantities. Note that this result is independent of the exact nature of B. However, feel free to prove the theorem for just the special case where the circuit B is a single emf E. We'll present two proofs. They're a bit tricky, so you may want to look at the first few lines to get started.
