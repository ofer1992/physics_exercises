## Problem Statement
A laminated conductor is made by depositing, alternately, layers of silver 100 angstroms thick and layers of tin 200 angstroms thick (1 angstrom = $10^{-10}$ m). The composite material, considered on a larger scale, may be considered a homogeneous but anisotropic material with an electrical conductivity $\sigma_⊥$ for currents perpendicular to the planes of the layers, and a different conductivity $\sigma_‖$ for currents parallel to that plane. Given that the conductivity of silver is 7.2 times that of tin, find the ratio $\sigma_⊥/\sigma_‖$.
