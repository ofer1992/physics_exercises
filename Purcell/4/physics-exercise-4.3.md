## Problem Statement
(a) Two resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, are connected in series, as shown in Fig. 4.30(a). Show that the effective resistance R of the system is given by $R = R_1 + R_2$. Check the $R_1 \to 0$ and $R_1 \to \infty$ limits.

(b) If the resistors are instead connected in parallel, as shown in Fig. 4.30(b), show that the effective resistance is given by $\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2}$. Again check the $R_1 \to 0$ and $R_1 \to \infty$ limits.
