## Problem Statement
A tetrahedron has equal resistors R along each of its six edges. Find the equivalent resistance between any two vertices. Do this by:

(a) using the symmetry of the tetrahedron to reduce it to an equivalent resistor;

(b) laying the tetrahedron flat on a table, hooking up a battery with an emf E to two vertices, and writing down the four loop equations. It's easy enough to solve this system of equations by hand, but it's even easier if you use a computer.
