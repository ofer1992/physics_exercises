## Problem Statement
(a) In Fig. 4.33, each segment represents a resistor R (independent of the length on the page). What is the effective resistance $R_{eff}$ between A and B? The numbers you encounter in your calculation should look familiar.

(b) What is $R_{eff}$ in the limit of a very large number of triangles? You can assume that they spiral out of the page, so that they don't run into each other. Your result should agree with a certain fact you may know concerning the familiar-looking numbers in part (a). Hint: In the infinite-triangle limit, if you add on another triangle to the left of A, the effective resistance along the new "spoke" must still be $R_{eff}$.
