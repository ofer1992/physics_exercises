## Problem Statement
A capacitor initially has charge Q. It is then discharged by closing the switch in Fig. 4.40. You might argue that no charge should actually flow in the wire, because the electric field is essentially zero just outside the capacitor; so the charges on the plates feel essentially no force pushing them off the plates onto the wire. Why, then, does the capacitor discharge? State (and justify quantitatively) which parts of the circuits are the (more) relevant ones in the two setups shown in Fig. 4.41.
