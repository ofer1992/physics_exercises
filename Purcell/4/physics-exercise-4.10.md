## Problem Statement
The basic ingredient in voltmeters and ammeters (at least ones from the old days) is the galvanometer, which is a device that can measure very small currents. (It works via magnetic effects, but the exact mechanism isn't important here.) Inherent in any galvanometer is some resistance $R_g$, so a physical galvanometer can be represented by the system shown in Fig. 4.35.

Consider a circuit such as the one in Fig. 4.36, with all quantities unknown. Let's say we want to measure experimentally the current flowing across point A (which is the same as everywhere else, in this simple circuit), and also the voltage difference between points B and C. Given a galvanometer with known $R_g$, and also a supply of known resistors (ranging from much smaller to much larger than $R_g$), how can you accomplish these two tasks? Explain how to construct your two devices (called an "ammeter" and "voltmeter," respectively), and also how you should connect/insert them in the given circuit. You will need to make sure that you (a) affect the given circuit as little as possible, and (b) don't destroy your galvanometer by passing more current through it than it can handle, which is generally much less than the current in the given circuit.
