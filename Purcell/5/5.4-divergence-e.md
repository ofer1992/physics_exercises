## Problem Statement
(a) Show that the divergence of the E field given in Eq. (5.15) is zero (except at the origin). Work with spherical coordinates.
(b) Now show that the divergence of E is zero by using Cartesian coordinates and the form of E given in Eq. (5.13). (Careful! There's something missing from Eq. (5.13).)
