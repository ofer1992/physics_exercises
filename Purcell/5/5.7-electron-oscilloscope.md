## Problem Statement
In the lab frame, the electric field in the region between the two plates of an oscilloscope is E. An electron enters this region with a relativistic velocity $v_0$ parallel to the plates. If the length of the plates is $\ell$, what are the electron's transverse momentum and transverse deflection distance upon exiting (as measured in the lab frame)? Solve this by working in the lab frame F, and then again by working in the inertial frame F' that coincides with the electron's frame when it enters the region. (You will need to use Eqs. (G.11) and (G.12). You may assume that the transverse motion is nonrelativistic.)
