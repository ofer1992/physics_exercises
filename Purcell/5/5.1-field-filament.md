## Problem Statement
On a nylon filament 0.01 cm in diameter and 4 cm long there are $5.0 \cdot 10^8$ extra electrons distributed uniformly over the surface. What is the electric field strength at the surface of the filament:
(a) in the rest frame of the filament?
(b) in a frame in which the filament is moving at a speed 0.9c in a direction parallel to its length?
