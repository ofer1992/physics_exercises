## Problem Statement
Suppose that the velocity of the test charge in Fig. 5.22 is chosen so that in its frame the electrons move backward with speed $v_0$.
(a) Show that the $\beta$ associated with the test charge's velocity in the lab frame must be $\beta = 2\beta_0/(1 + \beta_0^2)$.
(b) Using length contraction, find the net charge density in the test-charge frame, and check that it agrees with Eq. (5.24).
