## Problem Statement
Consider the second scenario in the example at the end of Section 5.8. Show that the total force in frame F' equals the sum of the electric and magnetic forces, provided that there is a magnetic field pointing out of the page with magnitude $\gamma vE_2/c^2$.

## Solution
Total force should be $\frac1\gamma qE_2$ according to lorentz transform from F to F'

Force from electric field in F' is pointed in y direction with magnitude $\gamma q E_2$

Using $qv\times B$ for the magnetic force we should have a force of magnitude $q\gamma v^2E_2/c^2$ pointing in the negative y direction.

Subtracting we get
$$qE_2 \gamma (1-\frac{V^2}{C^2}) =qE_2 \gamma \gamma^{-2}=qE_2/\gamma$$
