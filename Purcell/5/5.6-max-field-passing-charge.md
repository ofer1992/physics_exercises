## Problem Statement
In a colliding beam storage ring an antiproton going east passes a proton going west, the distance of closest approach being $10^{-10}$ m. The kinetic energy of each particle in the lab frame is 93 GeV, corresponding to $\gamma = 100$. In the rest frame of the proton, what is the maximum intensity of the electric field at the proton due to the charge on the antiproton? For about how long, approximately, does the field exceed half its maximum intensity?
