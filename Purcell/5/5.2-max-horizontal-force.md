## Problem Statement
A charge $q_1$ is at rest at the origin, and a charge $q_2$ moves with speed $\beta c$ in the x direction, along the line $z = b$. For what angle $\theta$ shown in Fig. 5.27 will the horizontal component of the force on $q_1$ be maximum? What is $\theta$ in the $\beta \approx 1$ and $\beta \approx 0$ limits?
