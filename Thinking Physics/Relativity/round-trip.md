## Problem Statement
Suppose our rocket ship is able to abruptly turn around when it emits its 10th flash and then return to earth at the same high speed. It continues sending flashes every 6 minutes and emits 10 in its hour of return. But these flashes are seen at 3-minute intervals on earth. So although a clock aboard the rocket ship will read 2:00 o'clock when the ship gets back to the earth (1 hour out and 1 hour back), clocks on earth will read:

a) 2:00 o'clock also
b) 2:30 o'clock
c) none of these
