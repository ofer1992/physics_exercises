## Problem Statement
Suppose our rocket ship departs from the earth at noon and travels at the same high speed for one hour, rocket time. During this hour it emits a flash every 6 minutes, ten in all. An earth observer sees these flashes at 12-minute intervals. When the 10th flash is emitted clocks aboard the rocket ship read 1:00. When the 10th flash is received on earth, clocks on earth read:

a) 1:00 o'clock
b) 1:30 o'clock
c) 2:00 o'clock
d) 2:30 o'clock
