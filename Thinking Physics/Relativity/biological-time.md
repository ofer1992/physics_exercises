## Problem Statement
There are all kinds of clocks: sand clocks, electric clocks, mechanical clocks, light clocks and biological clocks. Now just because motion can be shown to reduce the speed of one kind of clock must it necessarily affect all kinds of clocks equally?

a) Yes, it must affect all clocks equally
b) No, it need not affect all
