## Problem Statement
Ms. Bright is a young lady from the mythology of physics who can run faster than light. Of course, it could never be. But why can she, in fact, never run faster than light? The following reason is sometimes given: As Ms. Bright runs faster and faster her mass increases, so Ms. Bright finds she has become a very massive lady as she approaches the speed of light. She finds, also, that her muscles can no longer cope with the increased mass of her body. And that's it! Try as she will, she cannot go any faster.

a) The above explanation of why Ms. Bright cannot go faster than light is sound.
b) Ms. Bright cannot, in fact, run faster than light, but the above explanation of the reason why is not sound.
