## Problem Statement
You are standing near the middle of a long board which, as you perceive it, falls such that the two ends strike the ground simultaneously. You, therefore, think the board falls FLAT. But Ms. Bright (who is dashing by you near the speed of light) perceives end B striking the ground BEFORE end A and therefore thinks the board was TILTED to the right as it fell.

a) True
b) False
