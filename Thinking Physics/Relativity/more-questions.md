## Problem Statement
1. A spaceship travels away from its station at 3/4 c. It fires a rocket at 3/4 c in a direction directly away from the station. With respect to the space station, the rocket moves at speed:
   a) less than 3/4 c 
   b) 3/4 c 
   c) greater than 3/4 c but less than c 
   d) 1Â½ c

2. Nonmaterial things like shadows often exceed the speed of light.
   a) True 
   b) False

3. A train measures 110 meters long at rest. A tunnel measures 100 meters long at rest. At low speeds there is no point at which the train is completely inside the tunnel, but at relativistic speeds the train could be seen to be completely within the tunnel from the frame of reference of:
   a) the tunnel
   b) the moving train 
   c) both 
   d) neither

4. When a blinking source of light approaches you at high speed, you measure an increase in the:
   a) frequency of its light
   b) speed of its light
   c) both
   d) neither

5. According to Einstein's idea of gravity, a remote observer viewing light passing a very massive body would see the speed of light undergo:
   a) an increase 
   b) a decrease 
   c) no change whatsoever

6. Strictly speaking, from the point of view of a person on the ground floor of a tall skyscraper, a person at the top ages:
   a) slower 
   b) faster 
   c) the same
