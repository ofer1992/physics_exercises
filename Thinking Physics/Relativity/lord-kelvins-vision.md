## Problem Statement
Over a century ago, there lived a physicist named Lord Kelvin, who was Maxwell's teacher and whom we remember when we write Absolute Temperature as 273 K (273 Kelvin).

Lord Kelvin visualized all space filled with an invisible substance called "aether" and by means of this aether he accounted for the existence of both light and matter. At rest, aether was absolutely nothing but the empty vacuum of space. But set into vibration, the vibrations would spread through the aether like sound waves spread through the air. The aether waves were light waves. The atoms of matter were nothing more than tiny vortices in the aether, like a smoke ring is a vortex in air. The aether was frictionless, so once set in rotation the vortices would spin and therefore hold together forever.

Now pretend Kelvin's vision was correct and atoms were vortices in the aether and you could disrupt and destroy one of the vortex atoms. Would you expect the disruption to result in the release of kinetic energy?

a) Yes 
b) No
