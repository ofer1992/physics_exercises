## Problem Statement
This sort of situation troubles many physicists when they begin to think about relativity: A spacecraft is trying to escape a photon (of course, it will never escape). Let V be the speed, P the momentum, and E the energy of the photon as perceived by the astronaut when it hits the spacecraft. In what way will increasing the spacecraft's speed alter the astronaut's perceived values of V, P and E?

a) V, P and E will be constant and not change at all.
b) V, P and E will all decrease.
c) V and P will get smaller, E will not change.
d) V and E will get smaller, P will not change.
e) P and E will get smaller, V will not change.
