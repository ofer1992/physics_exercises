## Problem Statement
When current flows through a pair of parallel wires they are magnetically attracted if the current in both wires is in the same direction, and repelled if the currents are in opposite directions. This magnetic force is

a) the relativistic result of imbalanced electrostatic forces
b) an outcome of the mass-energy equivalence
c) a fundamental force of nature
d) all of these
e) none of these
