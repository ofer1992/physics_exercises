## Problem Statement
A comet is chasing a spacecraft. Let V be the speed of, P the momentum of, and E the energy of the comet as perceived by the astronaut when it hits the spacecraft. In what way would increasing the spacecraft's speed alter the astronaut's perceived values of V, P and E?

a) V, P and E will all be constant and not change at all.
b) V, P and E will all decrease.
c) V and P will get smaller, E will not change.
d) V and E will get smaller, P will not change.
e) E and P will get smaller, V will not change.
