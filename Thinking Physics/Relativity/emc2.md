## Problem Statement
The celebrated equation $E=mc^2$ or $m=E/c^2$ (c is the speed of light) tells us how much mass loss, m, must be suffered by a nuclear reactor in order to generate a given amount of energy, E. Which of the following statements is correct?

a) The same equation, $E=mc^2$ or $m=E/c^2$, also tells us how much mass loss, m, must be suffered by a flashlight battery when the flashlight puts out a given amount of energy, E.
b) The equation $E=mc^2$ applies to nuclear energy in a reactor, but not to chemical energy in a battery.
