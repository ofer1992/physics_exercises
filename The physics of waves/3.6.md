## Problem Statement
Consider the longitudinal oscillations of the system shown below:

The blocks are free to slide horizontally without friction. The displacements of the blocks from equilibrium are both measured to the right. Block 1 has a mass of 15 grams and block 2 a mass of 10 grams. The spring constants of the springs are $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$, as shown. The normal modes of this system are

$A_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$, $A_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$

with corresponding frequencies

$\omega_1 = 1$ s$^{-1}$, $\omega_2 = 2$ s$^{-1}$.

a. If the system is at rest at time $t = 0$ with displacements $x_1(0) = 5$ cm, $x_2(0) = 0$, or

$X(0) = \begin{pmatrix} x_1(0) \\ x_2(0) \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 5 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$ cm.

Find the displacement of block 2 at time $t = \pi$ s.

b. Find $K_1$, $K_2$ and $K_3$.
