## Problem Statement
For the system shown in figure 2.9, suppose that the displacement of the end of the wire vanishes for t < 0, and has the form $d_0 \sin \omega_d t$ for t â‰¥ 0.

a. Find the displacement of the block for t > 0. Write the solution as the real part of complex solution, by using a complex force and exponential solutions. Do not try to simplify the complex numbers. Hint: Use (2.23), (2.24) and (2.6).

b. Find the solution when $\gamma \to 0$ and simplify the result. Even if you got confused by the complex numbers in a., you should be able to find the solution in this limit. When there is no damping, the "transient" solutions do not die away with time!
