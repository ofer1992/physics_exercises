## Problem Statement
a. Prove (4.56).

b. Prove that if A and $$A'$$ are normal modes corresponding to different angular frequencies, $$\omega$$ and $$\omega'$$ respectively, where $$\omega^2 \neq \omega'^2$$, then $$bA + cA'$$ is not a normal mode unless b or c is zero. Hint: You will need to use the fact that both A and $$A'$$ are nonzero vectors.
