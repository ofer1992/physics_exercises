## Problem Statement
Prove, just using linearity, without using the explicit solution, that the steady state solution to (2.16) must be proportional to $F_0$.


$$ \frac{d^2}{dt^2} z(t) + \Gamma \frac{d}{dt} z(t) + \omega_0^2 z(t) = \mathcal{F}(t)/m\qquad (2.16)$$

## Solution

what does it mean for the solution to be proportional to $F_0$? That $F_1=2\cdot F_0 \Rightarrow z_1=2 \cdot z_0$?
Let $\tilde{z}$ be a solution for:
$F(t) = e^{-i\omega t}$

Define $z = F_0 \cdot \tilde{z}$. Then:

$\frac{d^2}{dt^2}z(t) + \Gamma\frac{d}{dt}z(t) + \omega_0^2z(t)$ = 

$= F_0(\frac{d}{dt^2}\tilde{z}(t) + \Gamma\frac{d}{dt}\tilde{z}(t) + \omega_0^2\tilde{z}(t))$

$= F_0e^{-i\omega t}/m$

Hence $z$ is a solution to a driving force with amplitude $F_0$, and is proportional to $F_0$.


This question isn't defined very well, in the sense that I can't really talk about the ss solution abstractly
