## Problem Statement
A system of four masses connected by springs is described by a mass matrix,

M = $\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 \end{pmatrix}$

and a K matrix

K = $\begin{pmatrix} 29 & -10 & -4 & -2 \\ -10 & 58 & -14 & -2 \\ -4 & -14 & 31 & -26 \\ -2 & -2 & -26 & 74 \end{pmatrix}$

a. Which of the following are normal modes?

$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ $\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ 2 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ $\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 1 \\ -1 \\ -1 \end{pmatrix}$ $\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ -3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$ $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \\ -4 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}$

b. For each normal mode, find the corresponding angular frequency. Hint: this requires
a little arithmetic. If you are lazy, you might want to use a programmable calculator or write
a little computer program to check these for you. But the point of this problem is to show
you that the amount of work required to check whether the vectors are normal modes is really
tiny compared to the work involved in finding the modes from scratch.

c. If blocks are released from rest from an initial displacement that is proportional to

$\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \\ -1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$

which normal mode is not present in the subsequent motion?

d. Find the normal coordinates corresponding to each of the normal modes of the system.
