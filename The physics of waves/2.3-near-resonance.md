## Problem Statement
For the system with equation of motion (2.14), suppose that the driving force has the form $f_0 \cos \omega_0 t \cos \delta t$ where $\delta \ll \omega_0$ and $\gamma = 0$. As $\delta \to 0$, this goes on resonance. What is the displacement for $\delta$ nonzero to leading order in $\delta/\omega_0$? Write the result in the form $\alpha(t) \cos \omega_0 t + \beta(t) \sin \omega_0 t$ and find $\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$. Discuss the physics of this result. Hint: First show that $\cos \omega_0 t \cos \delta t = \text{Re}(e^{-i(\omega_0+\delta)t} + e^{-i(\omega_0-\delta)t})/2$.
