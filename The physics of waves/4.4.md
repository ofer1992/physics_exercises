## Problem Statement

Show that (4.43) is the most general symmetric 6 Ã— 6 matrix satisfying (4.44).



![[4.1#Problem Statement]]

## Solution
It's basically the same proof I used for 4.1 except this time $K_{i,j -1}=K_{i+1,j}$ is used to prove the diagonals property. Well Perhaps a bit more is needed but not interesting enough.
