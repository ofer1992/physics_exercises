## Problem Statement
Consider the longitudinal oscillations of the system shown below:

The blocks are free to slide horizontally without friction. The displacements of the blocks from equilibrium are both measured to the right. Block 1 has a mass of 15 grams and block 2 a mass of 10 grams. The spring constants are shown in dynes/cm.

a. Show that the $M^{-1}K$ matrix of this system is
$M^{-1}K = \begin{pmatrix} 7 & -6 \\ -9 & 10 \end{pmatrix}$

b. Show that the normal modes are
$A_1 = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}$, $A_2 = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ -3 \end{pmatrix}$

Find the corresponding angular frequencies, $\omega_1$ and $\omega_2$.

## Solution

a. Straightforward computation.

b. $A_1$'s eigenvalue is 1, $A_2$'s is 16. The eigenvalue is $\omega^2$  so the frequencies are the sqrt, 1 and 4.
