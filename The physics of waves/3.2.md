## Problem Statement

Consider the vertical oscillation of a system of springs and masses with the following parameters:

Spring constants:
- KA = 78 dynes/cm
- KB = 15 dynes/cm  
- KC = 6 dynes/cm

The system consists of two masses:
- Mass 1: 1 gram
- Mass 2: 3 grams

Tasks:
1. Find the normal modes, normal coordinates and associated angular frequencies
2. If the 1g block is displaced up 1 cm from its equilibrium position with the 3g block held at its equilibrium position and both blocks released from rest, describe the subsequent motion of both blocks.
