## Problem Statement
a. Prove (4.56).

> If A and A' are normal modes of a system with the same angular frequency, w, then any linear combination, bA + cA', is also a normal mode with the same angular frequency.


b. Prove that if A and $A'$ are normal modes corresponding to different angular frequencies, $\omega$ and $\omega'$ respectively, where $\omega^2 \neq \omega'^2$, then $bA + cA'$ is not a normal mode unless b or c is zero. Hint: You will need to use the fact that both A and $A'$ are nonzero vectors.
