## Problem Statement
Prove that an overdamped oscillator can cross its equilibrium position at most once.

## Solution 

$z(t) = e^{\alpha t}$

$\alpha^2 + \Gamma\alpha + \omega_0^2 = 0$

$\alpha_{1,2} = \frac{-\Gamma \pm \sqrt{\Gamma^2 - 4\omega_0^2}}{2}$

If $\Gamma^2 - 4\omega_0^2 > 0$ then sqrt is real ie solution is decaying

$\Gamma > 2\omega_0$

The general solution is then

$z(t) = Ae^{\alpha_1t} + Be^{\alpha_2t}$

It crosses the equilibrium point when the component with the larger amplitude (in abs value) also decays faster.

Let $t_0$ be such that $z(t) = 0$. Then

$Ae^{\alpha_1t_0} + Be^{\alpha_2t_0} = 0$

$Ae^{(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)t_0} + B = 0$

$e^{(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)t_0} = -\frac{B}{A}$

$-\frac{B}{A}$ has to be positive so

$(\alpha_1-\alpha_2)t_0 = \log(-\frac{B}{A})$

$t_0 = (\alpha_1-\alpha_2)\log(-\frac{B}{A})$

We see it's uniquely defined hence can only happen once.
