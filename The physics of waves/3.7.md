## Problem Statement
In the system of problem [[3.5]], suppose we immerse the system in a damping
fluid so that

$\Gamma = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & \gamma \end{pmatrix}$

with $\gamma = 1 s^{-1}$, and that an external force of the following form is applied (in dynes):

$F(t) = f \cos \omega t = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \cos \omega t$

Find and graph the average power lost to the frictional force as a function of ω from ω = 0 to $10 s^{-1}$.

## Working notes

![[Screenshot_20241204_232733_Xodo.jpg]]

Matrix $M^{-1}k$ is defined as:
$$M^{-1}k = \begin{pmatrix} 7 & -6 \\ 9 & 10 \end{pmatrix}$$

Average power lost to $f$

$$M\ddot{x} + \Gamma \dot{x} + kx = F(t) = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \cos \omega_d t$$

So we have transient solutions and steady state solution.

Okay looking at the notes, average power by driving force is:
$$P_{avg} = \frac{1}{2}F_0 \omega_d B$$

Now $B$ is:
$$B = \frac{\Gamma \omega_d}{(\omega_0^2-\omega_d^2)^2+\Gamma^2\omega_d^2} \frac{F_0}{m}$$

The trick now is that we have a matrices and vectors.
