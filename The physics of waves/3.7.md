## Problem Statement
In the system of problem [[3.5]], suppose we immerse the system in a damping
fluid so that

$\Gamma = \begin{pmatrix} \gamma & 0 \\ 0 & \gamma \end{pmatrix}$

with $\gamma = 1 s^{-1}$, and that an external force of the following form is applied (in dynes):

$F(t) = f \cos \omega t = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \cos \omega t$

Find and graph the average power lost to the frictional force as a function of ω from ω = 0 to $10 s^{-1}$.
