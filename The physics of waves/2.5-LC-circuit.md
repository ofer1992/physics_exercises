## Problem Statement
For the LC circuit shown in figure 1.10, suppose that the inductor has nonzero resistance, R. Write down the equation of motion for this system and find the relation between friction term, $m\gamma$, in the damped harmonic oscillator and the resistance, R, that completes the correspondence of (1.105). Suppose that the capacitors have capacitance, $C \approx 0.00667\mu F$, the inductor has inductance, $L \approx 150\mu H$ and the resistance, $R \approx 15\Omega$. Solve the equation of motion and evaluate the constants that appear in your solution in units of seconds.
