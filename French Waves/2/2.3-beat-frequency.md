## Problem Statement
Two vibrations along the same line are described by the equations

$y_1 = A\cos 10\pi t$
$y_2 = A\cos 12\pi t$

Find the beat period, and draw a careful sketch of the resultant disturbance over one beat period.

## Solution 
$y_1 = A\cos \omega_1t$

$y_2 = A\cos \omega_2t$

$\alpha = 11\pi$

$\beta = \pi$

$$
\begin{align*}
\cos((\alpha-\beta)t) + \cos((\alpha+\beta)t) &= \cos\alpha\cos\beta t + \sin\alpha\sin\beta t \\
&+ \cos\alpha\cos\beta - \sin\alpha\sin\beta t \\
&= 2\cos\beta t\cos\alpha t
\end{align*}
$$

Period - Time to complete a circle $(2\pi)$

In beats theres a complication though, since the sign doesn't really matter the period is halved

$T_{beat} = 2S/2 = 1S$
