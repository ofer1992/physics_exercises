## Problem Statement
A particle is simultaneously subjected to three simple harmonic motions, all of the same frequency and in the x direction. If the amplitudes are 0.25, 0.20, and 0.15 mm, respectively, and the phase difference between the first and second is 45°, and between the second and third is 30°, find the amplitude of the resultant displacement and its phase relative to the first (0.25-mm amplitude) component.

## Solution
Just calculation...
$$\begin{align}
A_x&=0.25+0.20\cos 45^{\circ}+0.15 \cos 75^{\circ} \\
A_y&=0.20 \sin 45^{\circ}+0.15 \sin 75^{\circ}\end{align}$$

Then amplitude from Pythagoras, phase from atan2.
