## Problem Statement
A uniform rod of length $L$ is nailed to a post so that two thirds of its length is below the nail. What is the period of small oscillations of the rod?

## Solution 

$L$ is divided with $\frac{2}{3}$ below and $\frac{1}{3}$ above.

Can be solved with torques I think, or with center of mass?

For rotating rigid bodies...

$I_o = I_{cm} + Md^2$

$I_{cm} = ML^2/12$

$d = \frac{1}{6}L$

$$
\begin{align*}
I_o &= \frac{ML^2}{12} + M\left(\frac{L}{6}\right)^2 \\
&= \frac{ML^2}{12} + \frac{ML^2}{36} \\
&= \frac{4ML^2}{36} \\
&= \frac{ML^2}{9}
\end{align*}
$$

I think we can consider ext torque as acting on CM but I'm a little hazy on justification. Let's assume that though.

$\tau = -W\cdot\frac{1}{6}L\sin\theta= -\frac{1}{6}MgL\sin\theta$

So in total

$$-\frac{1}{6}MgL\sin\theta = \frac{ML^2}{9}\alpha$$

$$\alpha = -\frac{3g}{2L}\theta$$

Where $\theta = e^{i\omega t}$

$\omega^2 = \frac{3g}{2L}$

So angular velocity is $\omega = \sqrt{\frac{3g}{2L}}$

Since $\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$, $T = 2\pi/\omega = 2\pi\sqrt{\frac{2L}{3g}}$
