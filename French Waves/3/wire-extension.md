## Problem Statement
(a) An object of mass 0.5 kg is hung from the end of a steel wire of length 2 m and of diameter 0.5 mm. (Young's modulus = $2 \times 10^{11}$ N/m$^2$). What is the extension of the wire?

(b) The object is lifted through a distance $h$ (thus allowing the wire to become slack) and is then dropped so that the wire receives a sudden jerk. The ultimate strength of steel is $1.1 \times 10^9$ N/m$^2$. What is the largest possible value of $h$ if the wire is not to break?
