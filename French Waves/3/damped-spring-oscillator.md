## Problem Statement
An object of mass 0.2 kg is hung from a spring whose spring constant is 80 N/m. The object is subject to a resistive force given by $-bv$, where $v$ is its velocity in meters per second.

(a) Set up the differential equation of motion for free oscillations of the system.

(b) If the damped frequency is $\sqrt{3}/2$ of the undamped frequency, what is the value of the constant $b$?

(c) What is the $Q$ of the system, and by what factor is the amplitude of the oscillation reduced after 10 complete cycles?
