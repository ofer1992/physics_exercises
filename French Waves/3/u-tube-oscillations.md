## Problem Statement
A U-tube has vertical arms of radii $r$ and $2r$, connected by a horizontal tube of length $l$ whose radius increases linearly from $r$ to $2r$. The U-tube contains liquid up to a height $h$ in each arm. The liquid is set oscillating, and at a given instant the liquid in the narrower arm is a distance $y$ above the equilibrium level.

(a) Show that the potential energy of the liquid is given by
$$U = \frac{5}{8}g\rho\pi r^2y^2$$

(b) Show that the kinetic energy of a small slice of liquid in the horizontal arm (see the diagram) is given by
$$dK = \frac{1}{2}\rho \frac{\pi r^2}{(1 + x/l)^2} \left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2 dx$$
(Note that, if liquid is not to pile up anywhere, the product velocity Ã— cross section must have the same value everywhere along the tube.)

(c) Using the result of part (b), show that the total kinetic energy of all the moving liquid is given by
$$K = \frac{1}{4}\pi\rho r^2(l + \frac{5}{2}h)\left(\frac{dy}{dt}\right)^2$$
(Ignore any nastiness at the corners.)

(d) From (a) and (c), calculate period of oscillations if $l = 5h/2$.
