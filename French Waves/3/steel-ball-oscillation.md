## Problem Statement
(a) A solid steel ball is to be hung at the bottom end of a steel wire of length 2 m and radius 1 mm. The ultimate strength of steel is $1.1 \times 10^9$ N/m$^2$. What are the radius and the mass of the biggest ball that the wire can bear?

(b) What is the period of torsional oscillation of this system? (Shear modulus of steel = $8 \times 10^{10}$ N/m$^2$. Moment of inertia of sphere about axis through center = $2MR^2/5$.)
