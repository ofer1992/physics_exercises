## Problem Statement
A mass $m$ hangs from a uniform spring of spring constant $k$.

![[SmartSelect_20250131_130324_Xodo.jpg]]

(a) What is the period of oscillations in the system?

(b) What would it be if the mass $m$ were hung so that
(1) It was attached to two identical springs hanging side by side?
(2) It was attached to the lower of two identical springs connected end to end? (See Figure)
