## Problem Statement
A metal rod, 0.5 m long, has a rectangular cross section of area 2 mm$^2$.

![Rectangular rod clamped at bottom with coordinate system and force F applied at top]

(a) With the rod vertical and a mass of 60 kg hung from the bottom, there is an extension of 0.25 mm. What is Young's modulus (N/m$^2$) for the material of the rod?

(b) The rod is firmly clamped at the bottom as shown in the sketch, and at the top a force $F$ is applied in the $y$ direction as shown (parallel to the edge of length $b$). The result is a static deflection, $y$, given by

$$y = \frac{4L^3}{Yab^3} F$$

If the force $F$ is removed and a mass $m$, which is much greater than the mass of the rod, is attached to the top end of the rod, what is the ratio of the frequencies of vibration in the $y$ and $x$ directions (i.e., parallel to edges of length $b$ and $a$)?

(c) The mass is pulled aside in a certain transverse direction and released. It then traces a path like the one sketched. What is the ratio of $a$ to $b$?
