## Problem Statement
A platform is executing simple harmonic motion in a vertical direction with an amplitude of 5 cm and a frequency of $10/\pi$ vibrations per second. A block is placed on the platform at the lowest point of its path.

(a) At what point will the block leave the platform?
(b) How far will the block rise above the highest point reached by the platform?
