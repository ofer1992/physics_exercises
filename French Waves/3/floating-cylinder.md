## Problem Statement
A cylinder of diameter $d$ floats with $l$ of its length submerged. The total height is $L$. Assume no damping. At time $t = 0$ the cylinder is pushed down a distance $B$ and released.

(a) What is the frequency of oscillation?
(b) Draw a graph of velocity versus time from $t = 0$ to $t =$ one period. The correct amplitude and phase should be included.
