## Problem Statement
According to classical electromagnetic theory an accelerated electron radiates energy at the rate $Ke^2a^2/c^3$, where $K = 6 \times 10^9$ N-m$^2$/C$^2$, $e$ = electronic charge (C), $a$ = instantaneous acceleration (m/sec$^2$), and $c$ = speed of light (m/sec).

(a) If an electron were oscillating along a straight line with frequency $\nu$ (Hz) and amplitude $A$, how much energy would it radiate away during 1 cycle? (Assume that the motion is described adequately by $x = A \sin 2\pi\nu t$ during any one cycle.)

(b) What is the $Q$ of this oscillator?

(c) How many periods of oscillation would elapse before the energy of the motion was down to half the initial value?

(d) Putting for $\nu$ a typical optical frequency (i.e., for visible light) estimate numerically the approximate $Q$ and "half-life" of the radiating system.
