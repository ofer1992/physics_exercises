## Problem Statement
(a) Find the frequency of vibration under adiabatic conditions of a column of gas confined to a cylindrical tube, closed at one end, with a well-fitting but freely moving piston of mass $m$.

(b) A steel ball of diameter 2 cm oscillates vertically in a precision-bore glass tube mounted on a 12-liter flask containing air at atmospheric pressure. Verify that the period of oscillation should be about 1 sec. (Assume adiabatic pressure change with $\gamma = 1.4$. Density of steel = 7600 kg/m$^3$.)
