## Problem Statement
A wire of unstretched length $l_0$ is extended by a distance $10^{-3}l_0$ when a certain mass is hung from its bottom end. If this same wire is connected between two points, $A$ and $B$, that are a distance $l_0$ apart on the same horizontal level, and the same mass is hung from the midpoint of the wire as shown, what is the depression $y$ of the midpoint, and what is the tension in the wire?
