## Problem Statement
The motion of a linear oscillator may be represented by means of a graph in which $x$ is shown as abscissa and $dx/dt$ as ordinate. The history of the oscillator is then a curve.

(a) Show that for an undamped oscillator this curve is an ellipse.

(b) Show (at least qualitatively) that if a damping term is introduced one gets a curve spiraling into the origin.
