## Problem Statement
A mass $m$ rests on a frictionless horizontal table and is connected to rigid supports via two identical springs each of relaxed length $l_0$ and spring constant $k$ (see figure). Each spring is stretched to a length $l$ considerably greater than $l_0$. Horizontal displacements of $m$ from its equilibrium position are labeled $x$ (along $AB$) and $y$ (perpendicular to $AB$).

![Mass connected to two stretched springs on horizontal surface with x and y coordinates marked]

(a) Write down the differential equation of motion (i.e., Newton's law) governing small oscillations in the $x$ direction.

(b) Write down the differential equation of motion governing small oscillations in the $y$ direction (assume $y \ll l$).

(c) In terms of $l$ and $l_0$, calculate the ratio of the periods of oscillation along $x$ and $y$.

(d) If at $t = 0$ the mass $m$ is released from the point $x = y = A_0$ with zero velocity, what are its $x$ and $y$ coordinates at any later time $t$?

(e) Draw a picture of the resulting path of $m$ under the conditions of part (d) if $l = 9l_0/5$.
