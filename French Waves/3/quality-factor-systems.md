## Problem Statement
Many oscillatory systems, although the loss or dissipation mechanism is not analogous to viscous damping, show an exponential decrease in their stored average energy with time, $\bar{E} = \bar{E_0}e^{-\gamma t}$. A $Q$ for such oscillators may be defined using the definition $Q = \omega_0/\gamma$, where $\omega_0$ is the natural angular frequency.

(a) When the note "middle C" on the piano is struck, its energy of oscillation decreases to one half its initial value in about 1 sec. The frequency of middle C is 256 Hz. What is the $Q$ of the system?

(b) If the note an octave higher (512 Hz) takes about the same time for its energy to decay, what is its $Q$?

(c) A free, damped harmonic oscillator, consisting of a mass $m = 0.1$ kg moving in a viscous liquid of damping coefficient $b$ ($F_{\text{viscous}} = -bv$), and attached to a spring of spring constant $k = 0.9$ N/m, is observed as it performs damped oscillatory motion. Its average energy decays to $1/e$ of its initial value in 4 sec. What is the $Q$ of the oscillator? What is the value of $b$?
