## Problem Statement
Note: S refers to an inertial system x, y, z, t and S' refers to an inertial system x', y', z', t', moving along the x axis with speed v relative to S. The origins coincide at t = t' = 0. For numerical work, take c = 3 × $10^8$ m/s.

Assuming that v = 0.6c, find the coordinates in S' of the following events
(a) x = 4 m, t = 0 s.
(b) x = 4 m, t = 1 s.
(c) x = 1.8 × $10^8$ m, t = 1 s.
(d) x = $10^9$ m, t = 2 s.
