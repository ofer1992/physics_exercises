## Problem Statement
The relativistic transformation for acceleration derived in Problem 17 shows the impossibility of accelerating a system to a velocity greater than c. Consider a spaceship that accelerates at constant rate $a_0$ as measured by an accelerometer carried aboard, for instance a mass stretching a spring.

(a) Find the speed after time t for an observer in the system in which the spaceship was originally at rest.

(b) The speed predicted classically is $v_0 = a_0t$. What is the actual speed for the following cases: $v_0 = 10^{-3}c$, c, $10^3c$.
