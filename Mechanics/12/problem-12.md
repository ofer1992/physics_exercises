## Problem Statement
A light beam is emitted at angle $θ_0$ with respect to the x' axis in S'.

(a) Find the angle θ the beam makes with respect to the x axis in S.

(b) A source that radiates light uniformly in all directions in its rest frame radiates strongly in the forward direction in a frame in which it is moving with speed v close to c. This is called the headlight effect; it is very pronounced in synchrotron light sources in which electrons moving at relativistic speeds emit light in a narrow cone in the forward direction. Using the result of part (a), find the speed of a source for which half the radiation is emitted in a cone subtending $10^{-3}$ rad. (The sketch is considerably exaggerated, because $10^{-3}$ rad is only about 0.06 degree.)
