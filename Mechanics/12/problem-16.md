## Problem Statement
The pole-vaulter has a pole of length $l_0$, and the farmer has a barn $\frac{3}{4}l_0$ long. The farmer bets that he can shut the front and rear doors of the barn with the pole completely inside. The bet being made, the farmer asks the pole-vaulter to run into the barn with a speed v = $c\sqrt{3}/2$. In this case the farmer observes the pole to be Lorentz contracted to $l = l_0/2$, and the pole fits into the barn with ease. The farmer slams the door the instant the pole is inside, and claims the bet. The pole-vaulter disagrees: he sees the barn contracted by a factor of 2, so the pole can't possibly fit inside. Let the farmer and barn be in system S and the pole-vaulter in system S'. Call the leading end of the pole A, and the trailing end B.

(a) The farmer in S sees A reach the rear door at $t_A = 0$, and closes the front door at the same time $t_A = t_B = 0$. What is the length of the pole as seen in S?

(b) The pole-vaulter in S' sees A reach the rear door at $t'_A$. Where does the pole-vaulter see B at this instant?

(c) Show that in S', A and B do not lie inside the barn at the same instant.
