## Problem Statement
The relativistic transformation of acceleration from S' to S can be found by extending the procedure of Section 12.9. The most useful transformation is for the case in which the particle is instantaneously at rest in S' but is accelerating at rate $a_0$ parallel to the x' axis.

Show that for this case the x acceleration in S is given by $a_x = a_0/Î³^3$.
