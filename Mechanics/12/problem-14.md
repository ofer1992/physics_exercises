## Problem Statement
A slab of glass moves to the right with speed v. A flash of light is emitted from A and passes through the glass to arrive at B a distance L away. The glass has thickness D in its rest frame, and the speed of light in the glass is c/n. How long does it take the light to go from A to B?
