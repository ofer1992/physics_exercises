## Problem Statement
One of the most prominent spectral lines of hydrogen is the $H_α$ line, a bright red line with a wavelength of 656.1 × $10^{-9}$ m.

(a) What is the expected wavelength of the $H_α$ line from a star receding with a speed of 3000 km/s?

(b) The $H_α$ line measured on Earth from opposite ends of the Sun's equator differ in wavelength by 9 × $10^{-12}$ m. Assuming that the effect is caused by rotation of the Sun, find the period of rotation. The diameter of the Sun is 1.4 × $10^6$ km.
