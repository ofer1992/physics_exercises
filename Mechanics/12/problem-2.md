## Problem Statement
The improved apparatus used in 1887 by Michelson and Morley at the Case School of Applied Science (now Case-Western Reserve University) could detect a 0.01 fringe using sodium light, Î» = 590 nm. What is the upper limit to the Earth's velocity with respect to the ether set by this experiment? For comparison, the Earth's orbital velocity around the Sun is 30 km/s.
