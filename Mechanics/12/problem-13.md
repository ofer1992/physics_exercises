## Problem Statement
The frequency of light reflected from a moving mirror undergoes a Doppler shift because of the motion of the image. Find the Doppler shift of light reflected directly back from a mirror that is approaching the observer with speed v, and show that it is the same as if the image were moving toward the observer at speed $2v/(1 + v^2/c^2)$.
