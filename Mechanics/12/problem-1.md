## Problem Statement
Section 12.3 mentioned Maxwell's proposal for measuring the effect of source motion on the speed of light, using Jupiter's moons as clocks. In the sketch (not to scale), the inner circle is the Earth's orbit and the outer circle is Jupiter's orbit. The angle θ is the position of Jupiter with respect to the Earth's position. Jupiter's period is 11.9 years and the Earth's period is 1 year, so that $\dot{\theta} = 2\pi (11.9 - 1)$ rad/year = $2.2 \times 10^{-6}$ rad/s. The radius of Jupiter's orbit is $R_J = 7.8 \times 10^{11}$ m and the radius of Earth's orbit is $R_E = 1.5 \times 10^{11}$ m.

The problem is to find the time delay ΔT predicted by Maxwell's method. If s is the distance between Jupiter and Earth then

$$\Delta T = \frac{s}{(c - \dot{s})} - \frac{s}{(c + \dot{s})} \approx \frac{2s\dot{s}}{c^2}$$

Calculate the maximum value of ΔT.
