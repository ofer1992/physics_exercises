## Problem Statement
In Section 12.3 arm A of the Michelson-Morley interferometer was assumed to be along the line of motion and arm B perpendicular, and the predicted time difference according to the ether theory was

$$\Delta\tau = \frac{l}{c}\left(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)$$

Calculate the expected time difference if arm A is at angle Î¸ to the line of motion through the ether, as shown.
