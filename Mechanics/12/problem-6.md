## Problem Statement
Light in a Michelson-Morley interferometer makes a roundtrip, and the predicted time delay is second order, proportional to $v^2/c^2$. Here is an experiment that would give a first-order result proportional to v/c. Consider a laboratory moving through the ether with speed v in the direction shown. The observers have clocks and light pulsers. At time t = 0 A sends a signal to B a distance l away, sketch (a). B records the arrival time. The laboratory is then rotated 180°, reversing the positions of A and B. At time t = T, A sends a second signal to B, sketch (b).

(a) Show that according to the ether theory, the interval that B observes between the signals is T + ΔT, where

$$\Delta T \approx \frac{2l}{c}\frac{v}{c}$$

correct to order $(v/c)^3$.

(b) Assume that one clock in this experiment is on the ground and the other is in a satellite overhead. For a circular orbit with a period of 24 hours, l = 5.6 $R_e$, where $R_e$ is the Earth's radius = 6.4 × $10^6$ m. Using an atomic clock stable to within 1 part in $10^{16}$, what is the smallest value of v this experiment could detect?
