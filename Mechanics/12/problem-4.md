## Problem Statement
If the two arms of the Michelson interferometer have different lengths $l_1$ and $l_2$, show that the fringe shift when the interferometer is rotated by 90° with respect to the velocity v through the ether is

$$N = \left(\frac{l_1 + l_2}{\lambda}\right)\left(\frac{v^2}{c^2}\right)$$

where λ is the wavelength of the source light.
