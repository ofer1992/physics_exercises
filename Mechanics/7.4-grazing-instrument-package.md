## Problem Statement
A spaceship is sent to investigate a planet of mass $M$ and radius $R$. While hanging motionless in space at a distance $5R$ from the center of the planet, the ship fires an instrument package with speed $v_0$, as shown in the sketch. The package has mass $m$, which is much smaller than the mass of the spaceship. For what angle $\theta$ will the package just graze the surface of the planet?
