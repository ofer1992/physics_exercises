## Problem Statement
A ring of mass $M$ and radius $R$ lies on its side on a frictionless table. It is pivoted to the table at its rim. A bug of mass $m$ walks around the ring with speed $v$, starting at the pivot. What is the rotational velocity of the ring when the bug is
(a) halfway around?
(b) back at the pivot?
