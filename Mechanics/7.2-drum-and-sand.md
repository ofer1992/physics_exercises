## Problem Statement
A drum of mass $M_A$ and radius $a$ rotates freely with initial angular speed $\omega_A(0)$. A second drum with mass $M_B$ and radius $b > a$ is mounted on the same axis and is at rest, although it is free to rotate. A thin layer of sand with mass $M_s$ is distributed on the inner surface of the smaller drum. At $t = 0$, small perforations in the inner drum are opened. The sand starts to fly out at a constant rate $dM/dt = \lambda$ and sticks to the outer drum. Find the subsequent angular velocities of the two drums $\omega_A$ and $\omega_B$. Ignore the transit time of the sand.
