## Problem Statement
A clock C is at rest at the spatial origin of an inertial frame S. A second clock C' is at rest at the spatial origin of inertial frame S' moving with constant speed u relative to S. The clocks read t = t' = 0 when the two spatial origins coincide. When C' reads t'₂ it receives a radio signal from C sent when C reads t₁. Draw a space-time diagram showing this process.

Determine the space-time coordinates (ct₂, x₂) in S of the point (event) at which C' receives the radio signal. Hence show that

$$t_1 = t'_2\sqrt{\frac{1 - u/c}{1 + u/c}}$$
