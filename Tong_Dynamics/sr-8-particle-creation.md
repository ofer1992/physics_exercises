## Problem Statement
In a laboratory frame a particle of rest mass m₁ has energy E₁, and a second particle of rest mass m₂ is at rest. By considering the scalar quantity (P₁ + P₂)·(P₁ + P₂), or otherwise, show the combined energy in the centre of momentum frame (i.e. the frame in which the total 3-momentum is zero) is

$$\sqrt{m_1^2c^4 + m_2^2c^4 + 2E_1m_2c^2}$$

Hence show that in a collision between a proton with energy E and a proton at rest it is not possible to create a proton-antiproton pair (in addition to the original protons) if E < 7mc², where m is the rest mass of the proton and also of the antiproton.
