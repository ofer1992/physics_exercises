## Problem Statement
A particle of rest mass m₀ disintegrates into two particles of rest masses m₁ and m₂. Use conservation of relativistic energy and relativistic 3-momentum to show that the energies E₁ and E₂ of the particles in the rest frame of the original particle are given by

$$E_1 = c^2\frac{m_0^2 + m_1^2 - m_2^2}{2m_0}$$ and $$E_2 = c^2\frac{m_0^2 + m_2^2 - m_1^2}{2m_0}$$

Let P₀ be the 4-momentum of the original particle, and let P₁ and P₂ be the 4-momenta of the product particles. Derive the above results by expanding the invariant quantities (P₀ - P₁)·(P₀ - P₁) and (P₀ - P₂)·(P₀ - P₂).
