## Problem Statement
S and S' are inertial frames in a 2-dimensional space-time, the origins of which coincide. Observers O and O' are at the spatial origins of S and S' respectively. Observer O' moves at velocity u relative to observer O, where u > 0. Observer O observes a particle P passing through the origin and moving with velocity v, where v < u. The observer O' observes P moving with velocity -v.

Draw a space-time diagram, from O's point of view, to illustrate this situation. Use the relativistic velocity transformation law to show that

$$v = \frac{c^2}{u}\left(1 - \sqrt{1 - \frac{u^2}{c^2}}\right)$$

Writing u/c = tanh ϕ, find an expression for v/c in terms of the rapidity ϕ.
