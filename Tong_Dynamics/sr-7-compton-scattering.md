## Problem Statement
A photon (of zero rest mass) collides with an electron of rest mass m which is initially at rest in the laboratory frame. Show that the angle θ by which the photon is deflected (measured in the laboratory frame) is related to the magnitudes p and q of its initial and final momenta by

$$2\sin^2\frac{1}{2}θ = \frac{mc}{q} - \frac{mc}{p}$$
