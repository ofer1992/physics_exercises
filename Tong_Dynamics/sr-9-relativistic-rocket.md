## Problem Statement
A rocket ejects exhaust at constant speed u relative to itself by a process that conserves relativistic energy and momentum (but not mass!). Let m be the rest mass of the rocket when the rocket has speed v measured in the initial rest frame of the rocket.

By equating the 4-momentum of the rocket P with the total 4-momentum at a later time when the 4-momentum of the rocket is P + dP, show that

$$\frac{d(mγv)}{dv} = \left(\frac{v - u}{1 - uv/c^2}\right)\frac{d(mγ)}{dv}$$

where γ = (1 - v²/c²)⁻¹/². Rearrange this as a differential equation for mγ and derive the relativistic rocket equation

$$v = c\tanh\left(\frac{u}{c}\log r\right)$$

where r = m₀/m and m₀ is the initial rest mass of the rocket.

Now suppose that the rocket has an ideal photon drive, so that all matter to be ejected is converted first to photons by means of positron-electron annihilation. By considering directly initial and final energy and momentum (taking into account the total energy and momentum of the ejected photons, which you do not need to calculate), derive the relativistic rocket equation for the case of a photon-drive rocket.
