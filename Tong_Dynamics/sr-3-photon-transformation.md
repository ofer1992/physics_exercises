## Problem Statement
Write down the Lorentz transformation law for the energy and relativistic 3-momentum of a particle.

In an inertial frame S, a photon with energy E moves in the x - y plane at an angle θ relative to the x-axis. Show that in a second frame S' whose relative speed is u directed in the x-direction, the energy and angle are given by

$$E' = γE(1 - β \cos θ)$$ and $$\cos θ' = \frac{\cos θ - β}{1 - β \cos θ}$$

where β = u/c and γ = (1 - β²)⁻¹/². Write down E and cos θ as functions of E' and cos θ'.

For a photon moving in the x-direction, derive the relativistic Doppler effect by showing that there is a frequency change by a factor

$$\sqrt{\frac{1 - β}{1 + β}}$$

(*) How does this relate to question 1?

A source of photons is at rest in S'. Derive the headlight effect by showing that as u → c, the photons emitted in the forward direction (cos θ' > 0) in S are concentrated in a narrow cone about θ = 0.

(*) Show that the semi-angle of the cone is approximately $$\sqrt{2(1 - β)}$$.
