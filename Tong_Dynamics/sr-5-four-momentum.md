## Problem Statement
A particle with 4-momentum P is detected by an observer whose four-velocity is U. Working in the rest frame of the observer, express P · U in terms of the mass of the particle and its speed v in the observer's rest frame. Show that

$$\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{(P · P)c^2}{(P · U)^2}}$$
