## Problem Statement
Pulsars are stars which emit pulses of radiation at regular intervals. Bob and Ann count pulses from a very distant pulsar in the y direction. Ann travels at a speed given by β ≡ u/c = 24/25 in the x-direction for seven years and then comes back at the same speed, while Bob stays at home. At the end of the trip they have counted the same number of pulses. Use question 3 (with θ = ½π) to show that on return she has aged by 14 years and he by 50.

Obtain the corresponding result when the pulsar is in the x direction (question 3 with θ = 0), drawing a space-time diagram to show why Bob and Ann count the same number of pulses.
