## Problem Statement
A thick spherical shell (inner radius $a$, outer radius $b$) carries a current density $J = k(1/r)\hat{\phi}$, where $k$ is a constant. Show that the direction of the magnetic field inside the shell is along $\hat{z}$, but its magnitude varies with $r$ in such a way that $\nabla \cdot B = 0$. Find $B$ everywhere.
