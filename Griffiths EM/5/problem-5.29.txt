## Problem Statement
Suppose you want to define a magnetic scalar potential $U$ (Eq. 5.67) in the vicinity of a current-carrying wire. First of all, you must stay away from the wire itself (there $\nabla \times B \neq 0$); but that's not enough. Show, by applying Amp√®re's law to a path that starts at $a$ and circles the wire, returning to $b$ (Fig. 5.47), that the scalar potential cannot be single-valued (that is, $U(a) \neq U(b)$, even if they represent the same physical point). As an example, find the scalar potential for an infinite straight wire.
