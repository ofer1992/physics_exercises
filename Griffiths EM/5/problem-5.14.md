## Problem Statement
A steady current $I$ flows down a long cylindrical wire of radius $a$. Find the magnetic field, both inside and outside the wire, if:

a. The current is uniformly distributed over the outside surface of the wire.

b. The current is distributed in such a way that $J$ is proportional to $s$, the distance from the axis.
