## Problem Statement
A current $I$ flows down a wire of radius $a$.

a. If it is uniformly distributed over the surface, what is the surface current density $K$?

b. If it is distributed in such a way that the volume current density is inversely proportional to the distance from the axis, what is $J(s)$?
