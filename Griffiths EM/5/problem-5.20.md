## Problem Statement
a. Find the density $\rho$ of mobile charges in a piece of copper, assuming each atom contributes one free electron. [Look up the necessary physical constants.]

b. Calculate the average electron velocity in a copper wire 1 mm in diameter, carrying a current of 1 A. [Note: This is literally a snail's pace. How, then, can you carry on a long distance telephone conversation?]

c. What is the force of attraction between two such wires, 1 cm apart?

d. If you could somehow remove the stationary positive charges, what would the electrical repulsion force be? How many times greater than the magnetic force is it?
