## Problem Statement
Show that the magnetic field of an infinite solenoid runs parallel to the axis, regardless of the cross-sectional shape of the coil, as long as that shape is constant along the length of the solenoid. What is the magnitude of the field, inside and outside of such a coil? Show that the toroid field (Eq. 5.60) reduces to the solenoid field, when the radius of the donut is so large that a segment can be considered essentially straight.
