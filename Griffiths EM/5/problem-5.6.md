## Problem Statement
a. A phonograph record carries a uniform density of "static electricity" $\sigma$. If it rotates at angular velocity $\omega$, what is the surface current density $K$ at a distance $r$ from the center?

b. A uniformly charged solid sphere, of radius $R$ and total charge $Q$, is centered at the origin and spinning at a constant angular velocity $\omega$ about the z axis. Find the current density $J$ at any point $(r, \theta, \phi)$ within the sphere.
