## Problem Statement
a. A phonograph record of radius $R$, carrying a uniform surface charge $\sigma$, is rotating at constant angular velocity $\omega$. Find its magnetic dipole moment.

b. Find the magnetic dipole moment of the spinning spherical shell in Ex. 5.11. Show that for points $r > R$ the potential is that of a perfect dipole.
