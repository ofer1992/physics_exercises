## Problem Statement
a. Find the magnetic field at the center of a square loop, which carries a steady current $I$. Let $R$ be the distance from center to side.

b. Find the field at the center of a regular n-sided polygon, carrying a steady current $I$. Again, let $R$ be the distance from the center to any side.

c. Check that your formula reduces to the field at the center of a circular loop, in the limit $n \to \infty$.
