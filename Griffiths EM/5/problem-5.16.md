## Problem Statement
Two long coaxial solenoids each carry current $I$, but in opposite directions, as shown in Fig. 5.42. The inner solenoid (radius $a$) has $n_1$ turns per unit length, and the outer one (radius $b$) has $n_2$. Find $B$ in each of the three regions:
(i) inside the inner solenoid
(ii) between them
(iii) outside both.
