## Problem Statement
a. By whatever means you can think of (short of looking it up), find the vector potential a distance $s$ from an infinite straight wire carrying a current $I$. Check that $\nabla \cdot A = 0$ and $\nabla \times A = B$.

b. Find the magnetic potential inside the wire, if it has radius $R$ and the current is uniformly distributed.
