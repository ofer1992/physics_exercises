## Problem Statement
A particle of charge $q$ enters a region of uniform magnetic field $B$ (pointing into the page). The field deflects the particle a distance $d$ above the original line of flight, as shown in Fig. 5.8. Is the charge positive or negative? In terms of $a$, $d$, $B$ and $q$, find the momentum of the particle.
