## Problem Statement
Find the magnetic field at point P on the axis of a tightly wound solenoid (helical coil) consisting of $n$ turns per unit length wrapped around a cylindrical tube of radius $a$ and carrying current $I$. Express your answer in terms of $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$. Consider the turns to be essentially circular, and use the result of Ex. 5.6. What is the field on the axis of an infinite solenoid (infinite in both directions)?
