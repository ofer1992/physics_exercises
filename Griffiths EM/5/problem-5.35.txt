## Problem Statement
A circular loop of wire, with radius $R$, lies in the xy plane (centered at the origin) and carries a current $I$ running counterclockwise as viewed from the positive z axis.

a. What is its magnetic dipole moment?

b. What is the (approximate) magnetic field at points far from the origin?

c. Show that, for points on the z axis, your answer is consistent with the exact field (Ex. 5.6), when $z \gg R$.
