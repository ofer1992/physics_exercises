## Problem Statement
Suppose you have two infinite straight line charges $\lambda$, a distance $d$ apart, moving along at a constant speed $v$. How great would $v$ have to be in order for the magnetic attraction to balance the electrical repulsion? Work out the actual number. Is this a reasonable sort of speed?
